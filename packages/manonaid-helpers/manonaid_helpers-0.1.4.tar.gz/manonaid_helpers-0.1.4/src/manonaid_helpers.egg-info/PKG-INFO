# Requirements

Azure Storage connection string has to be set as environment variable `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` or
the seperate environment variables `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY` and `AZURE_STORAGE_NAME` which will be used to create the connection string.

Set variables like below:
For Windows PowerShell
$env:AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING = 'blahblahblah....'

For Command Prompt
set AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=blahblahblah....

# Usage

## Download

### 1. Fetch as pd.DataFrame

We can use the `returnAsDataFrameDict()` method to fetch one or multiple blobs as DataFrames

While fetching multiple blobs the return object is a dictonary of DataFrames with the blob name(with the extension) as the key.

If `type_correct_date_time_cols` is set as `True`: 
For all blobs that contain columns with names containing "date" or "time" are converted to datetime with format="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"

`delimitter` is set to`','` by default

```python
from manonaid_helpers.download import Download

df = Download(
    source="cyi5", 
    extension=".csv", 
    folder="pack_test/"
).returnAsDataFrameDict()

```

### 2. Download a specific folder from a container

We can download a folder by setting the `folder` argument.

```python
from manonaid_helpers.download import Download

Download(
   source='cyi5',
   folder="pack_test/",
   extension='.csv',
).returnAsDataFrameDict()
```

### 3. Download a given list of files

We can give a list of files to download with the `list_files` argument.

```python
from manonaid_helpers.download import Download

Download(
   source='cyi5',
   folder="pack_test/",
   extension='.csv',
   list_files=["20230301_ais_accuracy.csv"],
).returnAsDataFrameDict()
```

## List blobs

With the `Utils.list_blobs` method we can do advanced listing of blobs in a container or specific folder in a container.
We have several argument we can use to define our scope of information:

- `name_starts_with`: This can be used to filter files with certain prefix, or to select certain folders: `name_starts_with=folder1/subfolder/lastfolder/`
