pycax is a Python client for the Coordinated Assessments data exchange `REST API <https://www.streamnet.org/resources/exchange-tools/rest-api-documentation/>`__. Coordinated Assessments data eXchange (CAX) is developed by the Coordinated Assessments Partnership (CAP). CAP is a collaborative process to efficiently share and provide access to standardized derived information, such as fish population-scale high-level indicators (HLIs) and supporting metrics. Participants in CAP include state fish and wildlife management agencies, tribes, federal agencies such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries (NOAA Fisheries) and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), and others. CAP is co-sponsored by StreamNet and Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Partnership (PNAMP). Make sure to review the `StreamNet Terms of Use <https://nwfsc-math-bio.github.io/rCAX/articles/terms.html>`__ for these data, the `StreamNet Data Policy <https://www.streamnet.org/resources/exchange-tools/data-agreements/>`__ and the citation information from `StreamNet <https://www.streamnet.org/resources/citing-sn/>`__ and `PNAMP <https://www.pnamp.org/project/data-citation-and-attribution>`__ for database queries. pycax authors: Eli Holmes and Mari Williams, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries.

Installation
============

from pypi

.. code-block:: console

dev version

.. code-block:: console

    pip install git+git://github.com/nwfsc-math-bio/pycax.git#egg=pycax-client

Library API
===========

``pycax`` is split up into these modules

* ``datasets`` - The tables available for download with metadata.
* ``tables`` - Download an individual table given its name (as in the datasets table)
* ``hli`` - Download a HLI table in either "XPort" (default) or base format. "XPort" is the same as the CAP Tabular Query.

For accessing the HLI tables, you only need to import the `hli` module. A maximum of 1000 rows of data are downloaded (by default).
Typically you will want to filter the query by passing in `fargs` as dictionary with the column name values. For example,
`{'popid': 7}` would return popid equal to 7 only.

Examples of functions returning the data as a pandas data frame are shown.

HLI module
##########

.. code-block:: python

    from pycax import hli

    res = hli.getdf("NOSA", tabletype="xport", fargs={'popid':  7})
    res.head()


Tables module
#############

.. code-block:: python

    from pycax import tables

    res = tables.getdf("EscData", fargs={'popid':  7})
    res.head()

Datasets module
###############

.. code-block:: python

    from pycax import datasets

    res = datasets.getdf()
    res['name', 'id'].head()
