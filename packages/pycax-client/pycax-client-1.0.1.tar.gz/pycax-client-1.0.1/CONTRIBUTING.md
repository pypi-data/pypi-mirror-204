# Contributing to pycax

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Follow Installation instructions in the [README](https://github.com/nwfsc-math-bio/pycax/blob/master/README.md)
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Issue the pull request
    + a good title and a summary describing the changes you made with your set of edits
    + the pull request should do only one thing - single objective for a single PR.
