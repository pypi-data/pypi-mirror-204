# CircleCI-Stubs

This repository contains type stubs for the [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) library. The purpose of this package is to provide type hinting and improved type checking for users of the CircleCI library until the primary library includes the `py.typed` file.

## Installation

To install the CircleCI stubs, simply use `pip`:

```bash
pip install circleci-stubs
```

## Usage
After successfully installing the circleci-stubs package, type hinting and type checking for the CircleCI library should start working automatically with mypy or other compatible tools.

## Status
This package is meant to be a temporary solution, and we will gladly remove it once the main CircleCI library updated to include the required py.typed file.
We do not claim any warranties, and we are not affiliated with the original library maintainers.

## Contributing
If you find any issues or improvements in the stubs provided here, please feel free to open a Pull Request or an Issue on the project's GitHub repository.

## License
This package is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Acknowledgments
The circleci-stubs package is not officially affiliated with CircleCI or the original library. It is an independent effort by the community, intended to benefit users by providing type checking until the original library is updated.
