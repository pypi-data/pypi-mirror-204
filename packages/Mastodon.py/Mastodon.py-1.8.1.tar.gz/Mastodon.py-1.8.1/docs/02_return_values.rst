Return values
=============
.. py:module:: mastodon
.. py:class: Mastodon

Unless otherwise specified, all data is returned as Python dictionaries, matching
the JSON format used by the API. Dates returned by the API are in ISO 8601 format
and are parsed into Python datetime objects.

To make access easier, the dictionaries returned are wrapped by a class that adds
read-only attributes for all dict values - this means that, for example, instead of
writing

.. code-block:: python

    description = mastodon.account_verify_credentials()["source"]["note"]

you can also just write

.. code-block:: python

    description = mastodon.account_verify_credentials().source.note

and everything will work as intended. The class used for this is exposed as
`AttribAccessDict`.

Currently, some of these may be out of date - refer to the Mastodon documentation at
https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/ for when fields seem to be missing. This will
be addressed in the next version of Mastodon.py.
