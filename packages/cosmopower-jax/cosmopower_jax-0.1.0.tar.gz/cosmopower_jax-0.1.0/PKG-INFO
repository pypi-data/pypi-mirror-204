# CosmoPower-JAX

(We will add a logo soon!)

`CosmoPower-JAX` in an extension of the [CosmoPower](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower) framework to emulate cosmological power spectra in a differentiable way. With `CosmoPower-JAX` you can efficiently run Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with hundreds of parameters (for example, nuisance parameters describing systematic effects), on CPUs and GPUs, in a fraction of the time which would be required with traditional methods. We provide some examples on how to use the neural emulators below, and more applications in our paper (coming soon).

## Usage

We are working to make `CosmoPower-JAX` `pip`-installable. In the meantime, if you want to use the emulators of the matter power spectrum or of the CMB temperature and polarisation spectra, you can do as follows (coming soon).

## Example

We will make some examples available soon.

We currently do not provide the code to train a neural-network model in JAX; if you would like to re-train a JAX-based neural network on different data, [raise an issue](https://github.com/dpiras/cosmopower-jax/issues) or contact [Davide Piras](mailto:davide.piras@unige.ch).

## Contributing and contacts

Feel free to [fork](https://github.com/dpiras/cosmopower-jax/fork) this repository to work on it; otherwise, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/dpiras/cosmopower-jax/issues) or contact [Davide Piras](mailto:davide.piras@unige.ch).
