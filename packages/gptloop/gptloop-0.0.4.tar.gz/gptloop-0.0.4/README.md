# GPTLoop

GPTLoop is an AI-powered assistant that enhances work quality and efficiency across various tasks. Utilizing large language models and integrating external tools, GPTLoop adapts to user needs, providing tailored assistance to optimize workflows and deliver superior results. The platform operates within an iterative loop, continually refining its output based on user input and feedback.

To clarify and refine the GPTLoop concept, consider the following outline:

1.  **User Input**: The user provides the problem, along with any supporting materials, and the program generates an initial solution.
2.  **Divide and Conquer**: The program employs a divide and conquer approach to break down and solve the problem.

**The Loop**:

a. **Critical Evaluation**: Given the current solution, the program critically examines it, identifying and focusing on vital aspects. It then points out flaws in these key areas of the solution.

b. **Partial Solution Suggestions**: The program proposes partial solutions for the identified critical areas, deciding whether to:

i. Use reasoning to generate an improved solution.  
ii. Employ external tools to create a better solution.  
iii. Request user input to develop a superior solution.

c. **Solution Assessment and Refinement**: The program evaluates the updated partial solution to determine:

i. If the solution is large enough to be divided into smaller, more manageable parts.  
ii. If the solution is complete, satisfactory, and suitable as the final solution.

## Features
