"""
binaries hook for pygame seems to be required for pygame 2.0 Windows.
Otherwise some essential DLLs will not be transferred to the exe.

And also put hooks for datas, resources that pygame uses, to work
correctly with pyinstaller
"""
from PyInstaller.utils.hooks import collect_data_files

# from auraboros import __file__ as auraboros_main_file

# auraboros_folder = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(auraboros_main_file))

# datas is the variable that pyinstaller looks for while processing hooks
datas = collect_data_files('auraboros')
