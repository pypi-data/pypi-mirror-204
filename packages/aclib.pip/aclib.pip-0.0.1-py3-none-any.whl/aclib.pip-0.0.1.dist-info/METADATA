# Description

## Feature
 - acpip displays packages faster than pip.

 - acpip provides short commands, it make everything so easy.

 - acpip will analyze dependency relationship recursively when uninstall,

   then remind you if uninstalling package is required by other packages or not,

   also list the dependencies which are not required by other packages,
   except pip and setuptools, you can use option -d to uninstall them together.

   although they are not required by other packages, maybe your project is
   using some of them independently. so you can select
   which dependcies not to uninstall before uninstallation start,
   and if you select one, its dependencies will not be uninstalled either.

## About
   This is a new project, i couldn't know all about specification of python distribution temporarily,
   so sometimes i used pip to parse informations, it may be removed in future versions.
