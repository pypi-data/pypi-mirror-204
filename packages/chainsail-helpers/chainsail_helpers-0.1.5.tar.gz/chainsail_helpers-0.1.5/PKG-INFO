# Chainsail PDF interfaces and utilities

This small package complements the [Chainsail](https://chainsail.io) sampling service. It
- defines the general interface for objects representing Chainsail-consumable probability distributions,
- provides implementations thereof for popular probabilistic programming languages,
- and contains a few helper scripts for post-processing.

## Installation
```bash
$ pip install chainsail-helpers
```
If you'd like implement a probability density using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) or [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io), install the corresponding extra dependencies like so: `poetry install --extras pymc3` and similarly for `stan`. 
When using Chainsail, this package will be automatically installed, so no need to add it to the list of dependencies in the job submission form.
If you like to develop this package, best use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org):
```bash
$ poetry install
$ poetry shell
```
and you will be dropped into a virtual environment with all dependencies installed.

## Contributing
Contributions, for example PDF implementations for other probabilistic programming languages, are highly welcome!
Just open a pull request and we'll be happy to work with you to make Chainsail even more useful.
