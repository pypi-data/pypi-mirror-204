# TODOs

Here is a list of things that we need to do before the version 1.0.0, which will be the first
official release of the library. The code is already available on github at the following address:  
https://github.com/adriente/espm.git 
A draft of the documentation is available at: https://espm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

* Update the line 40 of `doc/introduction/index.rst` (@Adrien)
* Make some doc for the dataset module (just the minimum) (@Adrien)
    - Nati: I started doint it. I suggest to put all the function that create samples in dataset.samples.
* Separate the spectral and spacial parts (@Adrien)
    - Move generate_EDXS_phases to models
* Complete the general doc in `doc/introduction/index.rst` (@Adrien)
* Check that the doc is somehow understanable and sufficiently complete (@Sebastian)
* Add the reference to the dataset paper (@Nati) 
* add the reference to the algorithm paper (@Nati) 

@Adrien: Check the code in espm.weights. If you copy this code, you can generate figures for the doc. 
It seems that you need to have the title `Examples` for the system to work. `Example` does not work!
