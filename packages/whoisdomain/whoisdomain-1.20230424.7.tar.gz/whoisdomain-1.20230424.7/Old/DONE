  - tld ac; add registrant_country

  - email regex use \. in:  "emails": r"[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.[\w]{2,4}"
    this now results in valid data on google.com and meta.com and all derived from .com tld

  - add comment in tld_resgepr.py that emails, status, name_serevers are multi items (lists)
    and all the rest are single results.

  - add comments to beginning of tld_regexpr.py explaining that all matches are actually case insensitive (findall)
    and that many whois responses have trailing whitespace and may end in \r\n
    this helps with constructing regexes for future use

  - add skipFromHere in _2_parse.py: lines starting with ^>>> signify the end of a normal whois response
    after this line there is only human or legal information so we can simply skip that text
    (a similar construct with ^--\s will be done later)
    (( retracted we have domains where this is very early: switched off for now, make this configurable ))

  - add commment that unfortunately we cannot currently use rtrim on input from whois response and may regexes expect
    either \r or trailing whitespace, this can be done later and would make many regexes simpler in end detection

  - simplefy com.tr regex from multiple . to \.+, and add note on the trailing dot behind the date
    add meta.com.tr to regular testdata

  - fix test2.py cleanpostabmble for e.g com.sg which has lines at the top with ------------
  - add getops to makeTestDataAll.sh
  - allow maketestDataAll.sh -v -f -d com.sg to show the reduced input.out and the produced output of test2.py
  - add '[WHITESPACE AT END]' in input.out during input reduction test

  - add tld do, com.do, mo, com.mo, cx, dz (never answeres), gd, mn, gay, tl, tt (responds with perl script)

  - add -t <tld> and -d <dmian> to makeTastdataAll support a cusom domain and not meta, google default

  - add tld st, so, nrw, lat, so , realestate, ph, com.ph, org.ph, net.ph, zm

  -  fix tokyo, it needs a explicit server, add sy it has a whois server but i cannot get it to answer, set to privateReg
  -  add net.tr and tr (privateReg), onl, blue, garden, promo, one,

  -  add nic to default test group for makeTestdataAll.sh

  -  convert the list of tld to Dict
  -  allow override or change and adding new domains without needing a new version directly
  -  tested with existing testdomains, all reponses will now respond with the true tld not the one with a underscore

  - add simple autodetect based on tld from IANA, try to use the .com patterns to se if we get someting usefull
