A Python Library for Language Models

- Documentation: [https://protypo.entelecheia.ai][docs-url]
- GitHub: [https://github.com/entelecheia/protypo][repo-url]
- PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/protypo][pypi-url]

Protypo is a versatile and powerful Python library designed to facilitate the creation, training, and deployment of cutting-edge language models, a fundamental component in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The name Protypo is derived from the Greek word πρότυπο, meaning "prototype" or "model," reflecting the library's focus on providing a solid foundation for language model development.

## Features

Protypo offers a wide range of features that cater to both newcomers and experienced professionals in the NLP field:

- **Intuitive API**: Protypo provides an easy-to-use and user-friendly API, enabling developers to create, train, and fine-tune language models with minimal lines of code.
- **Flexible architecture**: The library supports various state-of-the-art language model architectures, such as Transformer, LSTM, and GRU, allowing users to experiment with different approaches and find the best fit for their projects.
- **Pre-trained models**: Protypo comes with a collection of pre-trained models for various languages, domains, and tasks, enabling users to leverage transfer learning and quickly adapt these models to their specific requirements.
- **Customizability**: Users can build custom language models from scratch or fine-tune existing ones, providing full control over model architecture, training parameters, and optimization techniques.
- **Multilingual support**: Protypo is designed with a focus on multilingualism, supporting a wide range of languages and facilitating seamless integration with other language resources and tools.

## Installation
