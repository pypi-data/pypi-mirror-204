Purpose: This module is to facilitate Python beginners, especially instructors and students of foreign languages and literature, for the convenience of easily operating txt, xlsx and json files as well as making word list. 

Function 1: Useful for getting data from the files directly and saving processing results in the files. Either task can be done with a single line of code.

Function 2: The functions of "FilePath" and "FileName" imported from the py file can effectively help you get all the absolute file paths in any folder (containing all the files of any sub-folder in the folder) of your PC disk and obtain the file names. This will be also realized within one line of code.

Function 3: You can make a word list of a certain file or a batch of files, showing their word frequency sorted in reverse order, easily with the function of "word_list" and "batch_word_list" in PgsFile.
