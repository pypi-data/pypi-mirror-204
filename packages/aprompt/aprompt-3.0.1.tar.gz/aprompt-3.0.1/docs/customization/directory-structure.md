# Directory Structure

Our project will be just an extension to *aprompt*. We name our project
*aprompt-year* and put the files we need into the `src` directory
located in our root directory.

```{attention}
This section will not explain how to package or publish the extension.
Read the
[official tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
to learn how to accomplish that:
```

Our directory structure will look as follows.

```text
aprompt-year/
├── src/
│   └── aprompt_year/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── formatters.py
│       ├── prompts.py
│       └── widgets.py
└── tests/
```
