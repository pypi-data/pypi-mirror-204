From an estimator to its tunning parameters and from optimizers to their parameters, the final goal is to automate the feature selection of the ML pipeline in a proper way. Optimizers like [Optuna](https://optuna.org/), [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) , [RandomizedSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html), [TuneGridSearchCV, and TuneSearchCV](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn) has critical role in Zoish. They are used to provide the best estimator on a train set that is later used by feature selectors to check what features can improve the accuracy of this best estimator based on desired metrics. In short, Optimizers use information every bit of information in rain set to select the best feature set. \n\nThe main process in Zoish is to split samples to train and validation set, and then optimization will estimate optimal hyper-parameters of the estimators. After that, this best estimator will be input to the feature selection objects and finally, the best subset of features with higher grades will be returned. This subset can be used as the next steps of the ML pipeline. In the next paragraphs, more details about feature selector modules have provided.\n\n### ShapFeatureSelectorFactory\n\nShapFeatureSelectorFactory uses  [SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874) (SHapley Additive exPlanation)  for a better feature selection. This package uses [FastTreeSHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09847) while calculating shap values and [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for plotting. Using this module users can : \n\n- find features using the best estimator of tree-based models with the highest shap values after hyper-parameter optimization.\n- draw some shap related plots for selected features.\n- return a  Pandas data frame with a list of features and shap values. \n\n### RecursiveFeatureEliminationFeatureSelectorFactory\n\nThe job of this factory class is to ease the selection of features by following a recursive elimination process. The process uses the best estimator found by the optimizer using all the features. Then it ranks the features according to their importance derived from the best estimator. In the next step, it removes the least important feature and fits again with the best estimator. It calculates the performance of the best estimator again and calculates the performance difference between the new and old results. If the performance drop is below the threshold the feature is removed, and this process will continue until all features have been evaluated. For more information on the logic of the recursive elimination process visit this [RecursiveFeatureElimination](https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_doc/selection/RecursiveFeatureElimination.html) page. \n\n### RecursiveFeatureAdditionFeatureSelectorFactory\nIt is very similar to RecursiveFeatureEliminationFeatureSelectorFactory, however, the logic is the opposite. It selects features following a recursive addition process. Visit [RecursiveFeatureAddition](https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_doc/selection/RecursiveFeatureAddition.html) for more details. \n\n### SelectByShufflingFeatureSelectorFactory\n\nIn this module, the selection of features is based on determining the drop in machine learning model performance when each feature’s values are randomly shuffled.\n\nIf the variables are important, a random permutation of their values will decrease dramatically the machine learning model performance. Contrarily, the permutation of the values should have little to no effect on the model performance metric we are assessing if the feature is not predictive. To understand how it works completely go to its official page [SelectByShuffling](https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_doc/selection/SelectByShuffling.html).\n\n### SingleFeaturePerformanceFeatureSelectorFactory\n\nIt selects features based on the performance of a machine learning model trained to utilize a single feature. In other words, it trains a machine-learning model for every single feature, then determines each model’s performance. If the performance of the model is greater than a user-specified threshold, then the feature is retained, otherwise removed.
