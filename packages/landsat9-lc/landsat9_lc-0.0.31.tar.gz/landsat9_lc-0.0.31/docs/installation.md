# Installation

At this moment only `python 3.10` is fully supported as other dependencies for `rioxarray` and `rasterio` 
are problematic to install on previous versions.
`pip install landsat9_lc`. Also at this moment only `linux` is supported as some of the packages
have some problems with `windows`. If you are using `windows` you can use `wsl` to create the environment and
you should be fine.
