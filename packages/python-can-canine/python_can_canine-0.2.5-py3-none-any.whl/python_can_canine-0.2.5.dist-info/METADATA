## python-can-canine



This module is a plugin that lets you use [CANine adapters](https://tinymovr.com/products/can-bus-adapter) with the [CANine firmware](https://github.com/tinymovr/CANine) in python-can.


### Installation

Install using pip:

    $ pip install python-can-canine


### Usage

Overall, using this plugin is quite similar to the main Python-CAN library, with the interface named `canine`. To integrate the Canine interface into your scripts, you can import constants, device designations, and more from the Python-CAN-Canine module using `import canine`. For most scenarios, incorporating a Canine interface is as easy as modifying Python-CAN examples with the lines provided below:

Create python-can bus with the Canine USB interface:

    import can
    from canine import CANineBus

    bus = can.Bus(interface="canine", bitrate=1000000)
