`SkyAGI` is a python package that demonstrates LLM's emerging capability in simulating believable human behaviors.
Specifically, `SkyAGI` implements the idea of [Generative Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) and delivers a role-playing game that creates a very interesting user experience.

Different from previous AI based NPC systems, `SkyAGI`'s NPC generates very interesting response and believable human behaviors.
The interesting observations in this demo show a huge potential for rethinking game development in many aspects.

To demonstrate this, `SkyAGI` provides example characters from `The Big Bang Theory` and `The Avengers` as a starting point.
Users could also define customized characters by creating config json files like [customized_character.json](https://github.com/litanlitudan/skyagi/blob/main/examples/example_agent.json)
For more details about the observations, refer to the [observations section](https://github.com/litanlitudan/skyagi/#interesting-observations-in-this-demo)

## Quick Start

Installation

```sh
pip install --upgrade skyagi
```

How to run

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
skyagi
# or
OPENAI_API_KEY="..." skyagi
```

For example if the OpenAI key is `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`, then the exact command would be the following

```sh
# make sure no quote around the token
export OPENAI_API_KEY=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
skyagi
# or
OPENAI_KEY_KEY=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 skyagi
```

To use example agent configs, download it from here: https://github.com/litanlitudan/skyagi/tree/main/examples
(pip install doesn't contain the agent configuration)
