# `pidgy` literate computing interface

![pidgy logo](pidgy.png "PIDGY written in large lower case sans serif text with the word WEAVE written in capital letters underneath the letters PID")

`pidgy` is a fun, literate and interactive style of programming in markdown & python. together, these languages offer an exciting new experience to rapidly co-develop of code and narrative in Jupyter computational notebooks.

## writing with `pidgy`

<figure markdown>

```bash
pip install pidgy
```
<figcaption>install <code>pidgy</code> with `pip`</figcaption>
</figure>


<figure markdown>

```ipython
%reload_ext pidgy
```
<figcaption markdown>

1. ü™ê open a jupyter notebook
2. üîå activate the <code>pidgy</code> extension
3. ‚úèÔ∏è program in markdown

## programming in markdown

markdown is inclusive AF![^a11y] it is a plain-text format that never fails [^violate].
further markdown can include any programming language within its contents.
effectively, markdown files are literate programs that really on code and narrative to cooperate. markdown is a global minimum for teams of people with different language literacies.

a <kbd>Tab</kbd> separates markdown code and narrative, `pidgy` uses this nearness to create python representations of the markdown. with code and narrative so close, an author can fluidly switch between the writing modes capturing more of their process.

[^a11y]: there are techniques for [improving accessibility of markdown] and abiding best practices.
[^violate]: markdown WILL violate expectation through implementation inconsistencies. over time we learn to navigate the nuances across products.
[^lite]: [jupyterlite] is a new in-the-browser jupyter experience that requires zero installation.
