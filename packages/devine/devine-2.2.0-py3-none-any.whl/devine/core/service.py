        Each Track in the Tracks should represent a Video/Audio Stream/Representation/Adaptation or
        a Subtitle file.

        While one Track should only hold information for one stream/downloadable, try to get as many
        unique Track objects per stream type so Stream selection by the root code can give you more
        options in terms of Resolution, Bitrate, Codecs, Language, e.t.c.

        No decision making or filtering of which Tracks get returned should happen here. It can be
        considered an error to filter for e.g. resolution, codec, and such. All filtering based on
        arguments will be done by the root code automatically when needed.

        Make sure you correctly mark which Tracks are encrypted or not, and by which DRM System
        via its `drm` property.

        If you are able to obtain the Track's KID (Key ID) as a 32 char (16 bit) HEX string, provide
        it to the Track's `kid` variable as it will speed up the decryption process later on. It may
        or may not be needed, that depends on the service. Generally if you can provide it, without
        downloading any of the Track's stream data, then do.
