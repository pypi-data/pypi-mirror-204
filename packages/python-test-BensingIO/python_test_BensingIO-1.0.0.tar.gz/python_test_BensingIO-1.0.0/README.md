# PyPi Upload Example

This is me testing how to build and push a project to PyPi that then can be pulled from git for other people to use.

## Working on the Repo Locally

1. Clone the repo using either http or ssh clone links
   1. http clone    `git clone https://github.com/bensing-io/pypi-test-bensing-io.git`
   2. ssh clone     `git clone git@github.com:bensing-io/pypi-test-bensing-io.git`
2. run `./venv-install.sh` to install the setup the virtual environment.
3. Verify all is working by running `python main.py`.  you should see a terminal respons of `Hi, BensingIO Test Package`
