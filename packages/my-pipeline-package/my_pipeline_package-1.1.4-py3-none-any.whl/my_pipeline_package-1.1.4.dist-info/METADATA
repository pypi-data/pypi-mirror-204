# DevOps Homework

Welcome to the Postscript DevOps take home task! This task should take you an hour or less to complete. You will be working with a simplified service with a minimal feature set.

## Background

At Postscript, we run a link shortening microservice that converts long URLs into short URLs (like an in-house [Bitly](https://bitly.com/)). To shorten links, we take the numeric identifier of the link and encode it using the [Base62 encoding scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base62).

This microservice is a simplified version of the encoding and decoding logic our link shortener uses. The service exposes two endpoints, `encode` and `decode`, as part of its API that another service could use to implement the link shortening logic.

## Requirements

As the next step to get this microservice into production, you are working on implementing a CI/CD pipeline to test and "deploy" the service as a Docker container. Your goal is to accomplish the following with your pipeline:

1. Test the application code on each commit and pull request using Github Actions
  - Tests are written in `test_app.py` and run with [Pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
2. Implement the `decode` function in `app.py`.
  - There are tests in `test_app.py` that can help you validate your solution.
  - Feel free to add additional tests as well.
3. Build a container image that runs the application as part of the CI pipeline.
  - A `Dockerfile` is included to use as a starting point or inspiration.
  - The container should run without errors and work as reasonably expected.
4. Publish the container image to a container registry.
  - Any container registry (Github Packages, ECR, Dockerhub, etc.) is OK.
  - If you cannot integrate with a live container registry due to cost, authentication, or other constraints, that's OK- comment out the uploading step of your pipeline and explain how it works instead.

You can change any of the code in the application, the tests, or the `Dockerfile` at your discretion. You can use any tools or resources you'd like to help you accomplish this task.

At the end of the task, please summarize your experience in `summary.md`. Outline the steps you took and how you solved problems as they came up.
