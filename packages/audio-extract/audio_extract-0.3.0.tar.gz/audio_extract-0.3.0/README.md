# Audio Extract

Extract and trim audio from videos or trim audios.

## Description

Audio Extract allows you to extract audio from video files and trim the audio according to your needs.
It supports various video and audio formats and has a simple and user-friendly interface.

It can also be used to trim audios.

## Installing

```bash
pip install audio-extract
```

## Executing the program

#### Extract full audio

```python
import audio_extract as audio_extract

audio_extract.run(input_path="./video.mp4", output_path="./audio.mp3")
```

This will create a mp3 file called `audio.mp3` that contains the full audio of the video file `video.mp4`.

#### Extract sub clip audio

```python
import audio_extract as audio_extract

audio_extract.run(input_path="./video.mp4", output_path="./audio.mp3", start_time="00:30")
```

This will create a mp3 file called `audio.mp3` that starts after the first 30 seconds of the video file `video.mp4`.

#### Extract sub clip audio with custom duration

```python
import audio_extract

audio_extract.run(input_path="./video.mp4", output_path="./audio.mp3", start_time="00:25", duration="01:15")
```

This will convert video file `video.mp4` to a mp3 file starting from `00:25` to `01:15`
called `audio.mp3` that will have a duration of `00:50`.

#### Trim audio

```python
import audio_extract

audio_extract.run(input_path="./audio.mp3", output_path="./new_audio.mp3", start_time="00:05", duration="01:15")
```

This will trim the `audio.mp3` file starting from `00:05` to `01:15`  to a mp3 file called `new_audio.mp3` that will
have a duration of `01:10`.
