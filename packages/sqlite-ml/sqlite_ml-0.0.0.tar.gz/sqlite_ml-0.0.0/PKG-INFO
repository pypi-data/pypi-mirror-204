# sqlite-ml

> An SQLite extension for machine learning

Train machine learning models and run predictions directly from your SQLite database.
Inspired by [PostgresML](https://postgresml.org).

## Why?

Why bother running Machine Learning workloads in SQLite? Good question!
Here are some answers:

- Machine Learning number one problem is data
- Instead of trying to bring the data to the model, why not bring a model along the data?
- Instead of exporting the data some place else, training a model, performing inference and bringing back the prediction into the database, why not do that directly alonside the data?
- Lots of ETL/ELT workloads are converging to pure SQL processing, why not do that also with predictions?
- The field of MLOps tries to unify the ML lifecycle but this is hard when working on multiple environments
- SQLite is fast
- The SQLite ecosystem is quite good (take a look at all the wonderful things around Datasette)
- SQLite is often used for ad-hoc data analysis, why not give the opportunity to also make predictions at the same time?
- Easy to integrate predictions for existings applications, use a simple SQL query!
