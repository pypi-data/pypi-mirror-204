# Known problems

1. Data is pulled from leaguepedia, so there is a limit as to how much data a normal user can pull. As a result, given a too-far-away-from-present date, program's result could be truncated or incorrect.
2. A BO3 series could be in the same day in local time, but in UTC (default time when pulled from API), 2 matches are on the same day and 1 match is on the next day (past midnight UTC time, but still the same day local time). 

Given the goal of this project (daily update for some busy fans), I decide not to address these problems. The program works consistently enough for what it is created for.

Cheers! ðŸŽ†
