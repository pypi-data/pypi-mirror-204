    r"""Write an extended XYZ file in the GAP format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xyz_path : :obj:`str`
        Path to the XYZ file to write.
    lattice : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``2``
        The three cartesian lattice vectors describing the periodic cell (in
        Angstroms).

        All structures need a this lattice even structures are not supposed to
        be periodic. Just use a lattice vector that is larger than twice the
        cutoff of any potential you plan to create or use.
    Z : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``1``
        Atomic numbers of all atoms in the system.
    R : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``3``
        Cartesian coordinates of all structures in the same order as ``Z``.
    E : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``1``
        Energy of all structures in ``R`` in units of eV.
    F : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``3``, default: ``None``
        Atomic forces of all structures in ``R`` in units of eV/A.
    lattice_precision : :obj:`int`, default: ``3``
        Number of decimal points to print for lattice dimensions.
    data_precision : :obj:`int`, default: ``10``
        Number of decimal points for printing array data.
