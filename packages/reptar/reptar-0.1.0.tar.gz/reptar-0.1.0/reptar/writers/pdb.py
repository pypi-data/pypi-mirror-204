def write_pdb(pdb_path, Z, R, entity_ids, comp_ids, atom_type="HETATM"):
    r"""Write PDB file containing a single structure or trajectory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pdb_path : :obj:`str`
        Path to PDB file to write.
    Z : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``1``
        Atomic numbers of each structure in ``R``.
    R : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``3``
        Cartesian coordinates.
    entity_ids : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``1``
        A uniquely identifying integer specifying what atoms belong to
        which entities. Entities can be a related set of atoms, molecules,
        or functional group. For example, a water and methanol molecule
        would be ``[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]``.
    comp_ids : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``1``
        Relates ``entity_id`` to a fragment label for chemical components
        or species. Labels could be ``WAT`` or ``h2o`` for water, ``MeOH``
        for methanol, ``bz`` for benzene, etc. There are no standardized
        labels for species. The index of the label is the respective
        ``entity_id``. For example, a water and methanol molecule could
        be ``['h2o', 'meoh']``.
    atom_type : :obj:`str`, default: ``'HETATM'``
        The PDB atom type to be used. Should almost always be ``HETATM``.
