def string_xyz_arrays(Z, R, *args, precision=10):
    r"""Create string of array data in XYZ format for a single structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Z : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim=1
        Atomic numbers of all atoms in the system.
    R : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim=2
        Cartesian coordinates of all atoms in the same order as ``Z``.
    args
        Other :obj:`numpy.ndarray` (ndim >= 1) to add where it's assumed the
        zero axis is with respect to ``R``. For example, if we have atomic
        forces the array shape would be ``(n, 3)`` where ``n`` is the number of
        atoms in the structure.
    precision : :obj:`int`, default: ``10``
        Number of decimal points for printing array data.

    Returns
    -------
    :obj:`str`
        The XYZ string for a single structure. This does not include the number
        of atoms
