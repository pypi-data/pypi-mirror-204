def write_ase_db(db_path, Z, R, energy=None, forces=None):
    r"""Create an atomic simulation environment database.

    Will add rows if the database already exists.

    Parameters
    ----------
    db_path : :obj:`str`
        Path to atomic simulation environment database.
    Z : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``1``
        Atomic numbers used to populate ``numbers`` in the ASE db.
    R : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``3``
        Cartesian coordinates used to populate ``positions`` in the ASE db.
    energy : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``1``, default: ``None``
        Energies to population ``energy`` in the ASE db.
    forces : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, ndim: ``3``, default: ``None``
        Atomic forces to populate ``forces`` in the ASE db.

    Returns
    -------
    ``ase.db.sqlite.SQLite3Database``
        Atomic simulation environment database.
