  r_prov_ids:
    description: >+
      Species an ID (int) to uniquely identifying labels for each structure if it originated from another reptar file.
      Labels should always be ``md5_structures``.
      For example, ``{0: '6038e101da7fc0085978741832ebc7ad', 1: 'eeaf93dec698de3ecb55e9292bd9dfcb'}``.

  r_prov_specs:
    description: >+
      Specifies ``structure_prov_id``, the ``structure index`` and original ``entity_id`` of the reptar prov.
      Take the following array for example.
      
              .. code-block:: python

                  [[0, 483,   0, 12],
                   [0,  89, 194,  2],
                   [1,   0,   0,  1]]
      
              This indicates that we should have three structures in our ``Group``.
              Structure one and two come from the ``Group`` that has a ``structure_prov_id`` of ``0`` whereas the last one is from a different ``Group`` (``structure_prov_id`` of ``1``).
              The first structure in this ``Group`` comes from the 484th (index of ``483``) structure in the source ``Group``.
              But this structure does not contain every atom from the original ``Group`` structure; it only contains the atoms from ``0`` and ``12`` ``entity_id``.
