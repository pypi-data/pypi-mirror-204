  md5_arrays:
    description: >+
      Unique string determined by all group arrays (i.e., data not stored in arrays are not included).
      This MD5 hash will not change as much when non-array data is added or removed.

      - attribute
    type: str
  md5_structures:
    description: >+
      Unique string determined by all group datasets (no attributes are included).
      This MD5 is only dependent on ``atomic_numbers`` and ``geometry``.
      Use this for breadcrumb purposes.

  comp_ids:
    description: >+
      Relates ``entity_id`` to a fragment label for chemical components or species.
      Labels could be WAT or h2o for water, MeOH for methanol, bz for benzene, etc.
      There are no standardized labels for species.
      The index of the label is the respective ``entity_id``.
      For example, a water and methanol molecule could be ``['h2o', 'meoh']``.
    storage:
      - dataset
    type: str
  comp_ids_num:
    description: >+
      Specifies the number of component IDs as an attribute.
      For example, ``{'H2O': 1, 'MEOH': 120}``
    storage:
      - attribute
    type: dict
  entity_ids:
    description: >+
      A uniquely identifying integer specifying what atoms belong to which entities.
      Entities can be a related set of atoms, molecules, or functional group.
      For example, a water and methanol molecule could be ``[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]``.
