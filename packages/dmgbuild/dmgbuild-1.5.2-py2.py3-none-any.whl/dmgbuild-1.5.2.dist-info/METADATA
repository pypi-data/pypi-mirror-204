NEW MAINTAINER WANTED
---------------------

Alastair, the existing maintainer, starts work for Apple on the 1st of June,
after which he likely won't be able to work on dmgbuild any more.  If anyone
would like to volunteer to maintain dmgbuild in the future, please get in
touch.

What is this?
-------------

``dmgbuild`` is a command line tool to create macOS disk images (aka
``.dmg`` files).  While it is possible to create disk images easily enough
from the command line using the ``hdiutil`` program that ships with macOS,
there is no easy way to configure the appearance of the resulting disk image
when the user opens it.

``dmgbuild`` allows for full customization of the resulting disk image,
without relying on Finder, and without using deprecated APIs (like the
Alias Manager functions).

See the documentation_ for more information.
