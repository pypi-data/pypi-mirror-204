# Configura

Configura is a Python configuration library that enables you to convert a folder of .json files into an easily accessible configuration folder.

## Usage

Say you have a folder with the following structure:

```
config_folder /
    main.json
    server.json
    misc.json
```

You can use configura to access those configurations like so:

```python
from configura import config

# Optionally, set your config folder here
# base_path defaults to "./config" so if your folder is named config, you don't have to modify this at all
config.base_path = "./config_folder"

# Print a misc.json as a dictionary
print(config.misc)
...

# Access data inside the misc.json as a dictionary
print(config.misc["model"])
```
