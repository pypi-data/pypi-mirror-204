# Usage
`easy-hmac` provides two helper functions for HMAC authentication:

- `generate_hmac_sha256` - generates a SHA256 HMAC from two strings (a secret
    key and a http message)
- `verify_hmac` - given an HMAC and a message, verifies if the HMAC generated by
    the message is equal to the one passed as argument
