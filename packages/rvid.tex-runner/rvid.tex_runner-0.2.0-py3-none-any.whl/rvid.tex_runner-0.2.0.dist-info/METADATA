# rvid.tex-runner

A small utility to ease programmatic usage of LaTeX from Python.

## Calling XeLaTeX on output

If you just run the `xelatex` command, you'll get a bunch of temp files output
to your current working directory. You also get a few screenfulls of debug out that
you only really want to see if something goes wrong. No big deal, but a bit of faff.

The function `rvid.tex_runner.make_pdf_at_path()` finds the xelatex-command, creates a
temp-directory, runs the command, moves the PDF-file into the location you
specified and then cleans up all the temp files.

```
def make_pdf_at_path(
    tex_content=a_string_that_holds_tex_source,
    target_path="/home/apa/bepa.pdf"
) 
```

If you want the resulting PDF returned as a bytestream instead written to disk, just
use `rvid.tex_runner.make_pdf_as_bytestream()` instead.

## When there is an error

XeLaTeX is run in nonstop mode and will not drop to an interactive prompt if there is a
problem. If a non-zero exit code is returned, the XeLaTeX output will be dumped to
stdout, even in silent mode.

## Handling paths to external resources

To handle external resources that are needed to build your PDF files, tex-runner has a
concept of `ExternalResource`. This is a Python object that contains a sequence of
absolute file paths and a relative target path (`basedir`) where your .tex files expect
to be able to include them from. For example:

```
ExternalResource(
    basedir="images",
    files=[
        "/Users/sean.banan/tex/img1.png",
        "/Users/sean.banan/tex/img2.png",
    ]
)
```

This concept also comes in handy if you have differing paths in different deployment
environments, since it allows you to abstract that away programmatically.

### Auto-generating ExternalResource-libraries

There is a utility function for auto-generating ExternalResource-objects from filesystem
paths:

```
>>> make_external_resource_library(source_directory="c:/pix", relative_target_directory="img")
ExternalResource(basedir="img", files=["c:/pix/q1.jpg"])
```

## Debugging

Change `rvid.tex_runner.latex:make_pdf_in_tempdir()` so that it doesn't delete
the tempdir after finishing the run.
