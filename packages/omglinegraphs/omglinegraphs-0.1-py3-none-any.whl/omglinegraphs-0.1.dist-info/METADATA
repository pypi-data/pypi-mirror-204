# linegraphs

The **omglinegraphs package** is a Python library for creating customizable line graphs. It provides an easy-to-use API for plotting data and adding labels, units, and increments to the axes. This package is ideal for data visualization and analysis in scientific and engineering applications.

## Features

- Customizable line graphs
- Support for multiple data sets
- Automatic determination of axis units
- Adjustable axis increments
- Save graphs to files in various formats
- API for creating and modifying graphs

## Installation

You can install the **omglinegraphs package** using pip:

```
pip install omglinegraphs
```

## Usage

To create a line graph, first import the `LineGraph` class from the `omglinegraphs` module:

```py
from linegraphs import LineGraph

graph = LineGraph()
```

Then, create an instance of the `LineGraph` class and call the relevant methods to customize the graph:

```py
graph = LineGraph()

# Add data points
data = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
graph.plot(data)

# Set title and axis labels
graph.title('My Graph')
graph.x_title('X-axis')
graph.y_title('Y-axis')

# Set axis units and increments
graph.x_unit('s')
graph.y_unit('m')
graph.x_incrementsby(1)
graph.y_incrementsby(0.5)

# Create the graph
graph.create()

# Save the graph to a file
graph.save('mygraph.png')

```
