""" 
A block object represents content within Notion. Blocks can be text, lists, media, and more. A page is a type of block, too.
Some blocks have more content nested inside them. Some examples are indented paragraphs, lists, and toggles. 
The nested content is called children, and children are blocks, too.

Block types which support children are:
    "paragraph", "bulleted_list_item", "numbered_list_item", "toggle", "to_do", "quote", "callout", 
    "synced_block", "template", "column", "child_page", "child_database", and "table". 
    All heading blocks ("heading_1", "heading_2", and "heading_3") support children when the is_toggleable property is true.

NOTE: The link_preview block will only be returned as part of a response. It cannot be created via the API.

        ##### WARNING: embed block types through the API are not reliable and often cause errors.

        Embed block types are:
        Framer, Twitter (tweets), Google Drive documents, Gist, Figma,
        Invision, Loom, Typeform, Codepen, PDFs, Google Maps, Whimisical,
        Miro, Abstract, excalidraw, Sketch, Replit
        There is no need to specify the specific embed type, only the URL.

        ### Differences in embed blocks between the Notion app and the API
        The Notion app uses a 3rd-party service, Embedly, to validate and request metadata for embeds given a URL.
        This works well in a web app because Notion can kick off an asynchronous request for URL information,
        which might take seconds or longer to complete, and then update the block with the metadata in the UI
        after receiving a response from Embedly.

        Embedly is not called when creating embed blocks in the API because the API needs to be able to return
        faster than the UI, and because the response from Embedly could actually cause us change the block type.
        This would result in a slow and potentially confusing experience as the block in the response would
        not match the block sent in the request.
        The result is that embed blocks created via the API may not look exactly
        like their counterparts created in the Notion app.
