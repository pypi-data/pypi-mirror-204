Turn 'noise' to signal: accurately rectify millions of erroneous short reads through graph learning on edit distances
=====================================================================================================================

A novel machine-learning-based error correction algorithm noise2read follows the diversity of the PCR and sequencing process to clear errors in short reads, including DNA and RNA sequencing (DNA/RNA-seq), small RNA, unique molecular identifiers (UMI) and amplicon sequencing data.
