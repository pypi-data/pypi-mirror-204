Harness the power of the DeepL API with this friendly user interface.

## Features

- Batch processing.

- Higher-level glossaries. [How do they work?](https://github.com/VoxelCubes/DeepQt/blob/master/docs/glossary_help.md)
  Apply replacements even without translating any of the text.

- Support for plain text and epub files.

## Requires

- A DeepL API license, either free or pro. [How do I get this?](https://github.com/VoxelCubes/DeepQt/blob/master/docs/api_help.md)

- A Python installation, version **3.10** or higher. On Linux you will probably already have this installed. On Windows, you will likely need to set it up. [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your package manager (apt, pacman, dnf, chocolatey, winget etc.)

## Installation

Download the latest release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/deepqt/).

```
pip install deepqt
```

Or on Arch Linux (and derivatives) via the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/deepqt/).

```
yay -S deepqt
```

Run it with `deepqt` from the terminal if installed with pip, or like any other application if installed another way.

Or download a prepackaged format from the [releases](https://github.com/VoxelCubes/DeepQt/releases/latest) page:

- .whl (Manual pip installation)
- .elf (Linux)
- .exe (Windows)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Build AppImage or Flatpak.
