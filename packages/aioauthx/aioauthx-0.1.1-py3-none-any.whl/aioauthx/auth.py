    Auth flows are used as part of custom req/rep handler classes for the
    session. Flows are async generator objects that yield requests and receive
    back response objects. Implementations can manipulate headers, cookies,
    etc before sending the next request.
    
    This framework allows for authentication schemes not natively supported in
    aiohttp to be used.
