Statistics are not logged; only toggling Dark/light mode and the stat names / source files.

Tested _only_ on `RX6000` series cards; more may be supported. Please file an issue if finding incompatibility!

## Installation / Usage
```
pip install amdgpu-stats
```
Once installed, run `amdgpu-stats` in your terminal of choice
## Requirements
Only `Linux` is supported. Information is _completely_ sourced from interfaces in `sysfs`.

It _may_ be necessary to update the `amdgpu.ppfeaturemask` parameter to enable metrics.

This is assumed present for *control* over the elements being monitored. Untested without. 

See [this Arch Wiki entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AMDGPU#Boot_parameter) for context.
