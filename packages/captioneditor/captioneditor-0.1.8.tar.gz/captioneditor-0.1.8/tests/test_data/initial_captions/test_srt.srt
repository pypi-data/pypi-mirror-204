00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,291
Hello, everybody out there.

00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,819
Welcome you all to SPIRIT Club

3
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,871
Virtual Boxing Fitness.

00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:00,863
My name is Kristian.

00:01:00,912 --> 00:01:02,755
Thank you all for being here

6
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,727
Along with me to give you all a 
great boxing workout, we have

7
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:08,197
two amazing trainers who are 
going to introduce themselves

8
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,669
to you all.

9
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,675
Hello, everyone.

10
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,447
My name is Marcela.

11
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:16,139
Very happy to be here with you.

12
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,109
I hope you guys enjoy the class.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,523
Hello, everyone.

14
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:22,039
My name is Avery.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,611
Thanks for joining us today.

16
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,735
Like Marcela said, I hope you 
guys are ready for a great class.

17
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:28,959
Let's jump right into it, 
Kristian.

18
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,795
All right, let's do it, Avery.

19
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:32,043
Let's do it, Marcela.

20
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:32,991
Let's go, everybody.

21
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,776
So we're going to kick our 
class off with some warm up

22
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:39,509
exercises so we can get the 
blood flowing, get our

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,339
body parts

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,703
ready for some action.

25
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:47,007
All right, so first thing we're 
going to start with everybody,

26
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:48,735
we're just going to do some 
side bends.

27
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:51,603
So let's spread those arms out 
to the side, and then we're

28
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:54,050
going to lean left to right, 
trying to reach those

29
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:57,529
fingertips as close to the 
floor as we can.

30
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,769
Here we go.

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,698
Good job, everybody.

32
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,859
Looking good, Avery and Marcela.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,091
Make sure you all are reaching 
those fingertips a little bit

34
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,649
lower each time.

35
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,871
Good work, Avery.

36
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:27,279
Good job, Marcela.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,515
10 seconds, everybody.

38
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:29,589
Keep it going.

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,239
5,

40
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,409
4,

41
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,379
3,

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,569
2,

43
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:39,759
and SPIRIT.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,419
Good job.

45
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,683
Next up, we're going to bring 
our elbows up to our sides and

46
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:45,719
we're going to twist left to 
right.

47
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,763
This is our torso twist.

48
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:51,421
We're going to open up our hips 
and our midsections by twisting

49
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:52,509
side to side.

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,629
Here we go.

51
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,649
Good job, everybody.

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,299
Nice work, Avery.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,231
Excellent, Marcela.

54
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,629
Keep it going, everybody.

55
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,331
All right, we're going to add 
on to our twist with some

56
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:25,779
punches so twist and punch.

57
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,649
Twist and punch.

58
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:30,209
Everybody, let's go.

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,819
Good job.

60
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,651
We got 15 seconds.

61
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:43,939
Let's go faster.

62
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,969
Pick it up.

63
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,099
5,

64
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,269
4,

65
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,469
3,

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,559
2,

67
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,135
and SPIRIT.

68
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:01,339
Awesome, everybody.

69
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,451
All right, we're going to move 
on to our arms next.

70
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:08,846
So we're going to wrap our arms 
up around our upper bodies,

71
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:11,552
give ourselves a nice big 
squeeze, and then we're going

72
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:14,204
to pull them apart, big and wide.

73
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:16,319
This is our SPIRIT fly.

74
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,149
Get our chest and shoulders 
nice and ready.

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,515
All right.

76
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:33,689
Nice stretch, Avery, way to 
open those arms up.

77
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,559
Awesome work, Marcela.

78
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,583
All right, everybody, 10 
seconds.

79
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:49,819
Let's try to pull those arms 
back further.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,749
5,

81
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,989
4,

82
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,199
3,

83
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,309
2,

84
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,011
and SPIRIT.

85
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:01,103
Nice, everybody.

86
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:03,131
Up next, we're going to do some 
swings.

87
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:06,667
We're going to do some leg 
swings and some arm swings.

88
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,279
So here's the leg swings.

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,575
If you want to do the arm 
swings, you can follow along

90
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:13,939
with Avery.

91
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,869
There it is right there.

92
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,029
Getting those legs and arms up.

93
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,849
Getting a nice reach, everybody, 
so let's get to it.

94
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,989
Good work, Marcela.

95
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,139
Good job, everyone.

96
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,389
Keep it going.

97
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,449
5,

98
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,819
4,

99
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,119
3,

100
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,299
2,

101
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,971
and SPIRIT.

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,229
Awesome.

103
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,769
All right, we're going to get 
into a little bit of cardio so

104
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,447
we can get our heart rates up.

105
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:04,059
So what we're going to do next, 
everybody, is some jump rope.

106
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,729
Let's get those invisible jump 
ropes out.

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,649
Get a bounce going.

108
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,089
Let's move it.

109
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,709
Good job, everybody.

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,635
All right.

111
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:30,139
Nice, Avery.

112
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,179
Good job, Marcela.

113
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,791
All right, you all, we're 
almost there.

114
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,371
We got 15 seconds.

115
00:06:47,436 --> 00:06:49,839
Let's see if we can move it a 
little faster.

116
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,135
Awesome.

117
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,789
We got 5,

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,899
4,

119
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,069
3,

120
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,239
2,

121
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:10,695
and SPIRIT.

122
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:13,069
All right, keep that bounce 
going, everybody.

123
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,779
Up next we're going to run in 
place.

124
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,827
So we're keeping our bounce 
going, but we're going to pump

125
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:23,855
our arms to go along with it.

126
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,649
So we're just running in place.

127
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,809
If you have some space, you can 
go side to side,

128
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,669
forward and back.

129
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,547
All right.

130
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:47,879
Nice arm swing, Avery, keep 
those arms pumping.

131
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,719
All right.

132
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,803
Nice, Marcela.

133
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,155
Let's double time, everybody.

134
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:00,059
Faster, faster, faster.

135
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,167
All right, so up next, we're 
going to do a little bit of

136
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:07,191
speedbag.

137
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:09,869
So we're going to keep the 
bounce going, but we're going

138
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:14,260
to roll one hand over the other 
as fast as we can, just like we

139
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,080
would if we're hitting the 
speedbag.

140
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,649
Let's do it.

141
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,269
You can go up, down, side to 
side,

142
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,929
just keep those hands rolling.

143
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,274
Good job, everybody.

144
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:37,779
10 seconds.

145
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,038
Look at those quick hands from 
Avery.

146
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,928
Good job.

147
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,689
5,

148
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,139
4,

149
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,349
3,

150
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,609
2,

151
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,919
and SPIRIT.

152
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,275
Excellent, everybody.

153
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:56,427
Good job, Marcela.

154
00:08:56,514 --> 00:08:57,831
Good job, Avery.

155
00:08:57,976 --> 00:09:00,849
All right, you all, we're going 
to take ourselves a quick break.

156
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,169
While we're taking our break, 
you all can get yourself set up

157
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,319
by having water, of course, so 
you can stay hydrated.

158
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,899
Keep a chair nearby just so you 
can rest up in between our

159
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,495
breaks.

160
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:17,845
And if you do have boxing 
gloves, you can get those laced

161
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:18,629
up now.

162
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,475
And we're going to start in 
about 30 seconds, everybody.

163
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:25,449
Good job with the warm up.

164
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,063
Hope you all are feeling fired 
up and ready to go.

165
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:30,889
We're going to have some fun 
today.

166
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,769
That was a great warm up.

167
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,607
Nice.

168
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:36,823
Yes, it was.

169
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:38,519
The music helped.

170
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,909
Yeah, definitely.

171
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,989
All right, Marcela, Avery, are 
we ready to go?

172
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,299
Ready to go.

173
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:48,939
Ready.

174
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,363
Let's do it.

175
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:54,209
All right, you all, so here we 
go.

176
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,411
First thing we're going to do, 
everybody, we're going to start

177
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:01,851
it off with a little general 
exercise so we can get a little

178
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:06,335
bit more warmed up, get our 
body nice and fluid.

179
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:08,607
So we're going to start off 
with some floor touches.

180
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:11,007
So we're going to reach those 
hands up high, and then we're

181
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:13,699
reaching them down towards the 
floor.

182
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,071
And even if you can't touch the 
floor, just reach those

183
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:20,559
fingertips as close as you can 
and try to get a little closer

184
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,491
each time.

185
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:23,459
So we're going up and down.

186
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,469
Let's do it.

187
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,109
Good work, Marcela.

188
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,529
Good job, Avery.

189
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,939
Awesome, everybody out there, 
keep it going.

190
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,339
We've got 10 seconds.

191
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,109
5,

192
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,379
4,

193
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,549
3,

194
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,729
2,

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,223
and SPIRIT.

196
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:05,459
Awesome, everybody.

197
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,283
All right, we're going to 
change gears now.

198
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:09,067
We're going into boxing mode.

199
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:11,143
So let's get those hands up.

200
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,527
The back hand is going to be 
covering the face.

201
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:15,671
The front is going to cover the 
body.

202
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:17,603
If you're doing this one 
standing, you're going to have

203
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:18,895
a staggered stance.

204
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:20,491
One foot in front of the other.

205
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:23,735
And we're just going to get a 
nice bounce going while we're

206
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:26,059
in our boxing stance.

207
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,589
All right, so let's do it.

208
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,009
Move around a little bit,

209
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,479
find your rhythm.

210
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,879
All right, there's Avery.

211
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,335
He's feeling it.

212
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:41,583
He's got those hands up.

213
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:42,869
He's ready for anything.

214
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,589
Marcela, same thing.

215
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,483
She's ready to go.

216
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:52,303
So let's do it, everybody, 
first punch.

217
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:55,311
We're going to start off with 
our right jab.

218
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:58,611
So we're just throwing a 
straightforward punch and then

219
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:02,649
back into our stance with the 
hands up.

220
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,399
So quick right jab.

221
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,009
And as you're throwing those 
punches, make sure you lean

222
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:19,500
into them to get more power, 
get better balance.

223
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,399
Let's see it, Marcela.

224
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,775
Nice.

225
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:24,769
Good job.

226
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,559
Way to step into those punches.

227
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,069
All right, let's switch it up 
to the left jab, everybody.

228
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,887
Left jab.

229
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:36,869
Let's go.

230
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,375
All right, there's Avery with 
those blazing flash jabs.

231
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:44,469
Good job.

232
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,107
Good work, everybody.

233
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:52,339
Let's bring the two together.

234
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,709
Now we're going right and left 
jab back to back.

235
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,189
Good job, everybody.

236
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,799
Right and left.

237
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,659
All right.

238
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,475
We change it up in the other 
direction.

239
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:20,495
We'll go left and right.

240
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:22,819
We'll go back and forth between 
the two.

241
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,069
Leading with the left, leading 
with the right.

242
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,219
Awesome, Marcela.

243
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,729
All right, everybody, we got 5,

244
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,089
4,

245
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,379
3,

246
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,859
2,

247
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,859
and SPIRIT.

248
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,089
Nice work.

249
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,523
All right, we've got one more 
thing before we move along.

250
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,303
We're going to take the floor 
touch and the jabs and we're

251
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:56,676
going to put the two together 
just so we can work on some

252
00:13:56,676 --> 00:14:00,604
coordination, being able to 
switch gears in an instant.

253
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:05,195
So we're going to touch our 
toes, pop up, one, two jab.

254
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:08,879
Floor touch, quick, jab, jab.

255
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,389
Awesome, everybody.

256
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,299
Floor touch, pop up, jab, jab.

257
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,391
There you go, Avery.

258
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,329
Nice work.

259
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,855
All right, let's take it a step 
further, everybody.

260
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,359
Floor touch, pop up, four jabs,

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,469
1, 2, 3, 4.

262
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,079
And a little bit more quickness 
with those punches.

263
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,029
Let's go.

264
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,203
Good job, Marcela.

265
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:51,889
10,

266
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,103
9,

267
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:54,049
GREAT!

268
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,149
7,

269
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,199
6,

270
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,389
5,

271
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,479
4,

272
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,599
3,

273
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,799
2,

274
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,539
and SPIRIT.

275
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,969
Way to go, everybody.

276
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,535
Great job.

277
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,659
Alright, we're gonna pass it 
along to Avery.

278
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,839
He's going to lead us with the 
next segment.

279
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,191
All right, Kristian, what we're 
going to start off doing this

280
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,119
time around, we're going to 
start off doing some shoulder

281
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:14,784
presses.

282
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:18,629
We're going to get about a good 
30 seconds in of just pressing

283
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:19,430
up,

284
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,589
like raising the roof.

285
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,569
Let's get about 30 seconds in 
of this, okay?

286
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,363
Just like that.

287
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:31,229
Great job.

288
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,269
There's Marcela.

289
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,539
Great job, Marcela.

290
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,049
Kristian raising the roof.

291
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,799
Already feeling the burn.

292
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,967
All right, we're about 15 
seconds in.

293
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,439
Let's finish it out strong.

294
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,009
Let's pick it up a little bit.

295
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,739
All right, 5,

296
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:04,909
4,

297
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,859
3,

298
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,159
2,

299
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:08,679
and SPIRIT.

300
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,631
All right, great job.

301
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:12,843
With that, we're going to jump 
right back into our boxing

302
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:13,572
stance.

303
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:17,027
This time around, we're going 
to start off just throwing some

304
00:16:17,038 --> 00:16:18,429
right hook punches, okay?

305
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,789
And remember, when you're 
throwing this hook punch, you

306
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,803
want to follow through all the 
way across the front of your

307
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:34,719
chest.

308
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,759
Great job, Kristian.

309
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,509
All right, we're going to 
switch to our left,

310
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,049
just left hook punches only.

311
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,719
Great job, Marcela.

312
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,943
All right, let's get a few more 
in and then we're going to put

313
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:13,068
them both together.

314
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,019
All right, let's put them both 
together.

315
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,749
That's going to be a right and 
a left.

316
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,749
Great job transitioning, guys.

317
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,509
Keep it up.

318
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,119
Great job, everyone.

319
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,049
Keep going.

320
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,051
Don't stop.

321
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:01,947
Don't think about it.

322
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,559
Just keep throwing those 
punches.

323
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,317
All right, let's get ready to 
put four of them together,

324
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:14,110
everyone.

325
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,899
So it's going to be

326
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,269
1,

327
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,759
2,

328
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,209
3,

329
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:17,779
4.

330
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,339
Four quick hook punches.

331
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,339
Great job, Marcela.

332
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,289
All right, let's go for 30 
seconds, let's finish it out.

333
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,619
And remember, you want to reset 
after you throw your punches.

334
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,831
Hands back up, four punches.

335
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:00,379
Hands up, four punches.

336
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,415
All right, we got 10,

337
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:11,423
9,

338
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:12,369
GREAT!

339
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,409
7,

340
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,649
6,

341
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,699
5,

342
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,949
4,

343
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,959
3,

344
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,079
2,

345
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,139
and SPIRIT.

346
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,203
All right, great job, everyone.

347
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,163
Before I pass it along to 
Marcela, we're going to jump

348
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:29,043
right back into our shoulder 
presses, and we're going to

349
00:19:29,054 --> 00:19:30,759
incorporate hook punches.

350
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,919
Let's say five chest presses, 
and then we're going to throw

351
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,616
four hook punches.

352
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:39,035
Okay?

353
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,079
So 1,

354
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,569
2,

355
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,139
3,

356
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,709
4,

357
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,309
5,

358
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,229
1,

359
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:43,619
2,

360
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,069
3,

361
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,599
4.

362
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,699
1,

363
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,129
2.

364
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,639
3,

365
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,139
4,

366
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,759
5,

367
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,749
1,

368
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,389
2,

369
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:49,779
3,

370
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,209
4.

371
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:51,329
All right?

372
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,791
Great job, everyone.

373
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:00,769
Keep it up.

374
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,095
Nice combination, Avery.

375
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,249
Feeling it.

376
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,169
All right, we got 10,

377
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,289
9,

378
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,855
GREAT!

379
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,719
7,

380
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,649
6,

381
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,969
5,

382
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,909
4,

383
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,209
3,

384
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,449
2,

385
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,499
and SPIRIT.

386
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,869
Awesome job, everyone.

387
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,687
Now I'll pass it along to 
Marcela and see what she has up

388
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:36,269
next.

389
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,403
All right.

390
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:38,423
Thank you, Avery.

391
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:42,599
Okay, our next target movement 
is going to be our jumping jacks.

392
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,607
So I'm going to be doing the 
standing version, which is I'm

393
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:48,619
going to tap to the side, bring 
my arms overhead

394
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,829
right in the middle.

395
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,264
If you're doing the advanced 
version, you can follow along

396
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:56,580
with Kristian.

397
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,209
Nice.

398
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,869
Nice work.

399
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,269
Good job, Avery.

400
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,459
Keep it going for 20 seconds.

401
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,709
10,

402
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,955
9,

403
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:35,963
GREAT!

404
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:36,909
7,

405
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,819
6,

406
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,099
5,

407
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,089
4,

408
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,019
3,

409
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,269
2,

410
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,809
and SPIRIT.

411
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:45,889
Awesome.

412
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,869
All right,

413
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,231
we're going to do our uppercut, 
so we're going to start with

414
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:52,979
the right uppercut.

415
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,687
You're going to lean on the leg 
that is in front of you and

416
00:21:56,698 --> 00:22:00,543
bring that uppercut all the way 
through your hips.

417
00:22:00,672 --> 00:22:01,989
All the way through.

418
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,469
So let's do it.

419
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,349
Right uppercuts.

420
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,149
Just like that.

421
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,019
Very good.

422
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,809
Good, Avery.

423
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,999
Okay, let's do our left 
uppercuts.

424
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,399
Left.

425
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,989
Good job, everyone.

426
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,789
Keep it going.

427
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,669
All right, let's do them 
together.

428
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,409
Right, left, right, left 
uppercuts.

429
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,519
All right, let's go.

430
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,169
Right and left, good job.

431
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,179
Good work, Avery.

432
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,259
Excellent.

433
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,119
Keep it going for 20 more 
seconds.

434
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,389
10,

435
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,409
9,

436
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,559
GREAT!

437
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:56,669
7,

438
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,939
6,

439
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,959
5,

440
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,359
4,

441
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,519
3,

442
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,849
2,

443
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,419
and SPIRIT.

444
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:07,279
All right, keep moving, guys.

445
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,627
We are going to add the jumping 
jack to our punches, so we're

446
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:14,639
going to do two jumping jacks, 
two uppercuts.

447
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,549
So let's try this.

448
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,389
That's 1,

449
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,249
2,

450
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,759
uppercut, uppercut.

451
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,749
1,

452
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,679
2,

453
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,269
uppercut, uppercut.

454
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,349
There you go.

455
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,869
Uppercut,

456
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,179
jumping jacks.

457
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,299
Nice.

458
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,069
Good job, Kristian.

459
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,739
Awesome, Avery.

460
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,799
Nice work.

461
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,489
10,

462
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,939
9,

463
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,429
GREAT!

464
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,029
7,

465
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,269
6,

466
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,139
5,

467
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,069
4,

468
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,989
3,

469
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,839
2,

470
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,239
and SPIRIT.

471
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,719
Great job.

472
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,543
All right.

473
00:25:40,662 --> 00:25:42,491
Amazing stuff, Marcela.

474
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:43,403
Good job, Avery.

475
00:25:43,452 --> 00:25:44,529
Good job, everybody.

476
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,319
Awesome work.

477
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,459
That was not easy combining 
those exercises with the punches.

478
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,129
Let's go get some water.

479
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,389
Good job, everyone.

480
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,739
Oh, man, that was tough.

481
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,339
Coordination.

482
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,769
Was it easy?

483
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,529
Not at all.

484
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,243
But we did it, Marcela and 
Avery, we made it through

485
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:13,609
everybody, so

486
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,863
we win.

487
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:18,839
But there's more to come, 
everybody, so good job.

488
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,563
That was our first round.

489
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,127
Before we officially take a 
break, we're going to pick

490
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:26,871
ourselves back up and get ready 
for our challenge, where we're

491
00:26:26,882 --> 00:26:29,927
going to do 1 minute of an 
exercise, and our goal is to

492
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:33,163
get as many reps of that 
exercise as we can.

493
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:36,969
So what we're going to do is 
we're going to do a little side

494
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,111
punching, so you can do this 
three different ways.

495
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,959
We got the seated version, we 
got Marcela

496
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,899
with the baseline,

497
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,763
and you can do it with me.

498
00:26:47,802 --> 00:26:50,629
So what I'll be doing is a side 
step

499
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,419
with a punch.

500
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,855
Side step, punch, punch.

501
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,903
So you're punching to the left 
and the right.

502
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,967
You can pick which punch you 
want to do.

503
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:04,889
You can do the jab, you can do 
the hook, or the upper cut.

504
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,097
So you're just turning your 
body to the side, throwing two

505
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:11,963
punches, same thing on the 
other side.

506
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:15,176
All right, so each side that 
you do, that's going to count

507
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,270
as one.

508
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,603
So in 10 seconds, we're going 
to get started and try to get

509
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:22,479
in as many as we can.

510
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,583
So everybody get into your 
stance, get that bounce going.

511
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:26,769
Let's get ready.

512
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,739
And here we go.

513
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,663
Side punches

514
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:34,275
in 3,

515
00:27:34,378 --> 00:27:34,883
2,

516
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:35,427
1,

517
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:36,549
let's do it.

518
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,869
Nice shot, Marcela.

519
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,099
Good work, Avery.

520
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,629
Awesome job, everybody, keep it 
going.

521
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,019
30 seconds, almost there.

522
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,029
20, keep it going, everybody.

523
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,299
Let's try to push a little bit 
harder.

524
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,049
10,

525
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,169
9,

526
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,289
GREAT!

527
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,409
7,

528
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,619
6,

529
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,899
5,

530
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,149
4,

531
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,139
3,

532
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,429
2,

533
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,299
and SPIRIT.

534
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,943
Awesome job, everybody.

535
00:28:52,142 --> 00:28:54,199
Good work, Marcela and Avery.

536
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,631
All right, on that note, let's 
go take a break, so pull up

537
00:28:58,642 --> 00:28:59,747
those chairs.

538
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,251
We're going to get about a 
minute of resting before we

539
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:05,809
pick it back up for round 
number two.

540
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,311
Way to go, everybody.

541
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,529
Awesome job.

542
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,249
All right, that was fun.

543
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,751
Worked our way through all 
three of our punches.

544
00:29:20,816 --> 00:29:24,149
Got a little cardio exercise in 
there.

545
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,553
So next step, we're going to 
work on some defensive moves

546
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:33,400
and bring those together to go 
along with the punches.

547
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,687
Avery and Marcela, do you two 
have a favorite punch of the

548
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,429
three?

549
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,299
I like the jab punch.

550
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,449
Jab punch, okay.

551
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,329
Marcela, which one do you like?

552
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,215
I like it all.

553
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:56,063
All of them?

554
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:58,719
Okay, you just like to throw 
punches?

555
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,889
Yes.

556
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,629
How about you?

557
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,299
I like the upper cut, I like 
the power punch.

558
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,575
Jab is fun, hook is good, but 
the upper cut, just bring all

559
00:30:16,586 --> 00:30:19,849
your energy together, and one 
boom, that's it, done.

560
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,175
The jab punch is kind of like a 
surprising punch, though, right?

561
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,449
So you can snap it real quick,

562
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,909
catch them.

563
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,803
And you don't have to use too 
much energy either.

564
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:32,589
Yeah.

565
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,869
All right, everybody, if you've 
got a favorite punch out there,

566
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,619
let us know in the chat.

567
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,775
All right, here we go.

568
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:47,215
So let's get back into it.

569
00:30:47,238 --> 00:30:50,171
We're going to do round number 
two now, and as I said, we're

570
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,247
going to add in some defense to 
go along with the moves that we

571
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:54,275
already worked on.

572
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:55,411
So let's get to it.

573
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,829
First things first, we're going 
to get into our boxing stance,

574
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:00,470
get those hands up, get that 
bounce going.

575
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,591
All right, our first defensive 
move, we're going to start off

576
00:31:06,602 --> 00:31:07,843
with the shoulder roll.

577
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:12,033
So for the shoulder roll, we're 
just leaning side to side,

578
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:14,184
rolling those shoulders left to 
right.

579
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,075
Just imagine there's a punch 
coming towards your face and

580
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:20,471
you've got to avoid that punch, 
so roll your shoulders as quick

581
00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:23,199
as you can so you don't get hit.

582
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,909
Let's go.

583
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,429
There's Avery doing a great job

584
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,799
with the quick side to side 
movement, avoiding those punches.

585
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,155
Good work, everybody.

586
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:43,987
So we practiced left to right.

587
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:46,389
Let's do the same thing right 
to left.

588
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,447
Awesome, Marcela.

589
00:31:48,544 --> 00:31:50,339
Way to add in the footwork.

590
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,810
All right, everybody, we're 
going to keep those shoulder

591
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:02,227
rolls going, but we're going to 
add two jabs and then shoulder

592
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:02,656
rolls.

593
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,727
So we're going left, right jab, 
following it up with the

594
00:32:05,738 --> 00:32:07,139
shoulder rolls.

595
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,149
Good work, everybody.

596
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,889
Jab, jab, shoulder roll.

597
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,675
As Avery mentioned earlier, 
after you finish your

598
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:23,729
combination, make sure you reset.

599
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:25,327
Get those hands back up.

600
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:27,567
Cover your face and your body.

601
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,959
Stay protected.

602
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,711
Awesome work, Avery.

603
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:33,279
Good job, Marcela.

604
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,559
All right, we're going to take 
it a step further, everybody.

605
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,015
We're going to add in another 
punch.

606
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:40,927
So we're still keeping our jab, 
jab, shoulder roll, but we're

607
00:32:40,938 --> 00:32:43,171
going to add in two hooks at 
the end.

608
00:32:43,226 --> 00:32:46,819
So jab, jab, shoulder roll, 
shoulder roll, hook, hook.

609
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,969
Let's go.

610
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,559
Awesome work, Marcela.

611
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,223
Nice job with those.

612
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:56,359
Quick punches.

613
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,619
Quick shoulder rolls.

614
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,675
Awesome, everybody.

615
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:04,909
We got 10,

616
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,029
9,

617
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,149
GREAT!

618
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,229
7,

619
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,459
6,

620
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,499
5,

621
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,729
4,

622
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,749
3,

623
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,979
2,

624
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,079
and SPIRIT.

625
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,855
Way to go, everybody.

626
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:18,849
Good job.

627
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,507
All right, Avery's

628
00:33:20,524 --> 00:33:22,849
going to show us our next move.

629
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,563
All right, Kristian, our next 
defensive move that we're going

630
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:27,663
to practice here today is going 
to be the duck.

631
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:28,115
All right?

632
00:33:28,138 --> 00:33:31,989
So if you're doing it seated 
like myself, it's sort of like a

633
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,631
seated crunch.

634
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,283
So I'm just going to duck like 
this.

635
00:33:35,322 --> 00:33:36,655
My hands are still going to be 
up.

636
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,269
My head is going to be up so I 
can see.

637
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,871
I'm going to duck like this.

638
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:43,091
Okay, let's just practice.

639
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:46,569
You can check out Marcela and 
Kristian if you're standing to

640
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,755
follow along with them.

641
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:48,349
Okay?

642
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,299
Great job, Marcela.

643
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,191
Remember, when you're ducking, 
you still want to keep your

644
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:00,369
guard up.

645
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,707
Sometimes when you duck, that's 
when you get caught with that

646
00:34:05,718 --> 00:34:07,211
uppercut, Kristian.

647
00:34:07,356 --> 00:34:08,289
Oh, yeah.

648
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,009
Hands up, everybody.

649
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,709
Great job.

650
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,036
All right, let's rock this out 
for about another 20 seconds,

651
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:23,219
and then we're going to add 
some punches.

652
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,319
Great work, everyone.

653
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,329
Keep it up.

654
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,171
All right.

655
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:38,923
10,

656
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:39,869
9,

657
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,069
GREAT!

658
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,169
7,

659
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,218
6,

660
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,549
5,

661
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:45,849
4,

662
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:46,999
3,

663
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,249
2,

664
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,959
and SPIRIT.

665
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,138
All right, we're still going to 
keep our guards up.

666
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,959
We're still practicing our duck.

667
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,246
Now, this time around, we're 
going to duck, and then we're

668
00:34:56,257 --> 00:34:59,143
going to throw a right hook and 
a left hook.

669
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,999
Okay, so we're going to duck, 
right, left.

670
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,649
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

671
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,759
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

672
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,429
Great job transitioning, 
everyone.

673
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,179
Good work, Kristian.

674
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,369
Excellent.

675
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,139
Great job, Marcela.

676
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,399
All right, 20 seconds.

677
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,947
All right, let's finish it out 
strong, everyone.

678
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:57,669
10,

679
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,949
9,

680
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,149
GREAT!

681
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,489
7,

682
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,649
6,

683
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,269
5,

684
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,829
4,

685
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,359
3,

686
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,889
2,

687
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,595
and SPIRIT.

688
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:14,115
All right, we're going to keep 
that same process going, but

689
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:15,575
this time we're going to

690
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,649
duck, hook, hook, duck again, 
right uppercut, left uppercut.

691
00:36:20,706 --> 00:36:22,859
Okay, so that's going to be a 
duck,

692
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,879
hook, hook, another duck,

693
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,387
uppercut, upper cut.

694
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:28,109
Okay?

695
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,799
Duck, hook, hook, duck again, 
uppercut, uppercut.

696
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,239
Great.

697
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,329
Just like that.

698
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,399
30 seconds.

699
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,589
Let's knock it out.

700
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,299
Literally.

701
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,219
Great work, Kristian.

702
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,119
Great job, Marcela.

703
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,319
All right, 15 seconds.

704
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,091
All right.

705
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:16,843
10,

706
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:17,789
9,

707
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,989
GREAT!

708
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,379
7,

709
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,319
6,

710
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,629
5,

711
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,999
4,

712
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,309
3,

713
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,969
2,

714
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,959
and SPIRIT.

715
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,087
Great work, everyone.

716
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:32,143
Great work.

717
00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:34,849
All right, Marcela, what do you 
have for us next?

718
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,419
All right, our next defense 
move is going to be the block.

719
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,590
So for this one, try to bring 
those elbows together right in

720
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:44,629
front of our face to protect.

721
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,383
So we're going to start first 
with our blocks.

722
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:50,099
Side to side blocks.

723
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,619
Again.

724
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,869
Just like that.

725
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,709
Very good.

726
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,799
Good job, Kristian.

727
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,619
Nice, Avery.

728
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,903
We're going to keep going with 
this block, and we're going to

729
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:32,419
add some punches to the block.

730
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,939
Let's do that for another 10 
seconds,

731
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,339
9,

732
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,709
GREAT!

733
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,919
7,

734
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,259
6,

735
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,429
5,

736
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,689
4,

737
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,909
3,

738
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,259
2,

739
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,359
and SPIRIT.

740
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,507
Good job, everyone, keep moving.

741
00:38:50,674 --> 00:38:52,555
Time for our uppercuts.

742
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,239
So we're going to do a block, 
uppercut, uppercut.

743
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,549
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

744
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,239
Nice.

745
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,709
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

746
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,079
Excellent.

747
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,839
Block,

748
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,919
and uppercuts.

749
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,719
Looking good, Avery.

750
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,629
Good job.

751
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,879
Nice, Kristian.

752
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,009
Good job, Marcela.

753
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,309
Get ready to add another punch.

754
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,759
So we're going to do

755
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,819
block, uppercut, uppercut, 
block, jab, jab.

756
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,469
Block, uppercut, uppercut, 
block, jab, jab.

757
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,739
Block, uppercut, uppercut, 
block, jab, jab.

758
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,899
There we go.

759
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,899
A lot to think in here.

760
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,049
Nice work.

761
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,209
Good job, Kristian.

762
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,829
Nice, keep it up, keep it up, 
almost there.

763
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,179
10,

764
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,789
9,

765
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,299
GREAT!

766
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,589
7,

767
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,789
6,

768
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,099
5,

769
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,819
4,

770
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,099
3,

771
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,379
SPIRIT.

772
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,199
Awesome.

773
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,919
All right.

774
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,011
Way to go, Marcela.

775
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,689
Way to go, Avery.

776
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:51,151
That was a real workout, 
everybody.

777
00:40:51,286 --> 00:40:52,483
Good job.

778
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:54,869
Let's go get another quick sip 
of water.

779
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,587
All right, congratulations, 
everybody.

780
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:07,375
We made it to the finish line, 
and we did it with style.

781
00:41:07,488 --> 00:41:09,735
You all did an amazing job 
today.

782
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:12,146
So what we're going to do next, 
we're going to finish it off

783
00:41:12,158 --> 00:41:15,186
with some cool down stretches 
so we can relax all those

784
00:41:15,198 --> 00:41:17,879
muscles that we fired up today.

785
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,983
Our first stretch, we're going 
to start off with the side bend.

786
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:22,103
We're going to get our core.

787
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:24,279
We did a lot of twisting and 
turning.

788
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,469
We're going to

789
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,125
help those muscles relax by 
bringing one arm up and over

790
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,250
and leaning to the opposite side.

791
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,399
We'll hold it for 10 seconds

792
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,619
and then switch.

793
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,467
3,

794
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:45,395
2,

795
00:41:45,578 --> 00:41:47,443
and switch it up.

796
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:49,509
Same thing on the other side.

797
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,409
5,

798
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,409
4,

799
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,249
3,

800
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,079
2,

801
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,003
and SPIRIT.

802
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:05,543
Good job.

803
00:42:05,582 --> 00:42:07,282
Now we're going to take both 
hands and we're going to reach

804
00:42:07,294 --> 00:42:10,551
them down towards the floor, 
and we're going to hold it.

805
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:13,670
If you're standing up, try to 
keep those legs nice and

806
00:42:13,682 --> 00:42:14,619
straight.

807
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,139
Reach down towards the floor.

808
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,829
5,

809
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:29,739
4,

810
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,659
3,

811
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,599
2,

812
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,523
and SPIRIT.

813
00:42:32,572 --> 00:42:33,119
Good job.

814
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,079
Last one, everybody.

815
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,993
We're going to reach in the 
opposite direction now, hands

816
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:38,292
up above our head.

817
00:42:38,346 --> 00:42:41,155
Get those shoulders and arms 
stretched out.

818
00:42:41,178 --> 00:42:43,316
If you want to get your lower 
back in the mix, you could push

819
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,369
your hips forward and lean back.

820
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,943
And we'll hold it for 10,

821
00:42:52,142 --> 00:42:52,983
9,

822
00:42:53,182 --> 00:42:53,975
GREAT!

823
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,929
7,

824
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:55,879
6,

825
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,759
5,

826
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:57,769
4,

827
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,649
3,

828
00:42:58,770 --> 00:42:59,539
2,

829
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,519
and SPIRIT.

830
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,549
Awesome job today, everybody.

831
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,527
Great work, Avery.

832
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,095
Good job, Marcela.

833
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:09,415
Awesome work, Kristian and 
Avery.

834
00:43:09,528 --> 00:43:12,055
And all of you, great job.

835
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:13,403
Great job, everyone.

836
00:43:13,522 --> 00:43:14,615
Great work, Marcela.

837
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:17,949
Great work, Kristian, awesome 
class, love the energy.

838
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,711
Lots of fun as always, 
everybody, thank you all again

839
00:43:23,722 --> 00:43:25,971
for being a part of this thing 
with us.

840
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,803
