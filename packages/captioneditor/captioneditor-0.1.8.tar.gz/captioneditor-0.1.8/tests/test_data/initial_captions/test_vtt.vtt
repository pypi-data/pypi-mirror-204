00:52.880 --> 00:54.291
Hello, everybody out there.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.819
Welcome you all to SPIRIT Club

00:57.480 --> 00:59.871
Virtual Boxing Fitness.

00:59.936 --> 01:00.863
My name is Kristian.

01:00.912 --> 01:02.755
Thank you all for being here
today.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.727
Along with me to give you all a
great boxing workout, we have

01:05.738 --> 01:08.197
two amazing trainers who are
going to introduce themselves

01:08.208 --> 01:09.669
to you all.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.675
Hello, everyone.

01:11.858 --> 01:13.447
My name is Marcela.

01:13.544 --> 01:16.139
Very happy to be here with you.

01:16.290 --> 01:18.109
I hope you guys enjoy the class.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.523
Hello, everyone.

01:20.642 --> 01:22.039
My name is Avery.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.611
Thanks for joining us today.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.735
Like Marcela said, I hope you
guys are ready for a great class.

01:26.918 --> 01:28.959
Let's jump right into it,
Kristian.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.795
All right, let's do it, Avery.

01:30.828 --> 01:32.043
Let's do it, Marcela.

01:32.092 --> 01:32.991
Let's go, everybody.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.776
So we're going to kick our
class off with some warm up

01:35.788 --> 01:39.509
exercises so we can get the
blood flowing, get our

01:41.000 --> 01:42.339
body parts

01:43.480 --> 01:44.703
ready for some action.

01:44.752 --> 01:47.007
All right, so first thing we're
going to start with everybody,

01:47.018 --> 01:48.735
we're just going to do some
side bends.

01:48.768 --> 01:51.603
So let's spread those arms out
to the side, and then we're

01:51.614 --> 01:54.050
going to lean left to right,
trying to reach those

01:54.062 --> 01:57.529
fingertips as close to the
floor as we can.

01:58.620 --> 01:59.769
Here we go.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.698
Good job, everybody.

02:08.850 --> 02:10.859
Looking good, Avery and Marcela.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.091
Make sure you all are reaching
those fingertips a little bit

02:14.102 --> 02:15.649
lower each time.

02:24.660 --> 02:25.871
Good work, Avery.

02:25.936 --> 02:27.279
Good job, Marcela.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.515
10 seconds, everybody.

02:28.618 --> 02:29.589
Keep it going.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.239
5,

02:35.590 --> 02:36.409
4,

02:36.630 --> 02:37.379
3,

02:37.750 --> 02:38.569
2,

02:38.698 --> 02:39.759
and SPIRIT.

02:39.840 --> 02:40.419
Good job.

02:40.490 --> 02:43.683
Next up, we're going to bring
our elbows up to our sides and

02:43.694 --> 02:45.719
we're going to twist left to
right.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.763
This is our torso twist.

02:47.892 --> 02:51.421
We're going to open up our hips
and our midsections by twisting

02:51.432 --> 02:52.509
side to side.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.629
Here we go.

03:03.180 --> 03:04.649
Good job, everybody.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.299
Nice work, Avery.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.231
Excellent, Marcela.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.629
Keep it going, everybody.

03:18.980 --> 03:22.331
All right, we're going to add
on to our twist with some

03:22.342 --> 03:25.779
punches so twist and punch.

03:27.420 --> 03:28.649
Twist and punch.

03:28.716 --> 03:30.209
Everybody, let's go.

03:40.200 --> 03:40.819
Good job.

03:40.890 --> 03:42.651
We got 15 seconds.

03:42.736 --> 03:43.939
Let's go faster.

03:44.020 --> 03:44.969
Pick it up.

03:54.380 --> 03:55.099
5,

03:55.510 --> 03:56.269
4,

03:56.630 --> 03:57.469
3,

03:57.800 --> 03:58.559
2,

03:58.880 --> 04:00.135
and SPIRIT.

04:00.248 --> 04:01.339
Awesome, everybody.

04:01.490 --> 04:05.451
All right, we're going to move
on to our arms next.

04:05.506 --> 04:08.846
So we're going to wrap our arms
up around our upper bodies,

04:08.846 --> 04:11.552
give ourselves a nice big
squeeze, and then we're going

04:11.552 --> 04:14.204
to pull them apart, big and wide.

04:14.332 --> 04:16.319
This is our SPIRIT fly.

04:18.100 --> 04:22.149
Get our chest and shoulders
nice and ready.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.515
All right.

04:30.618 --> 04:33.689
Nice stretch, Avery, way to
open those arms up.

04:39.420 --> 04:41.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.583
All right, everybody, 10
seconds.

04:46.632 --> 04:49.819
Let's try to pull those arms
back further.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.749
5,

04:55.170 --> 04:55.989
4,

04:56.330 --> 04:57.199
3,

04:57.440 --> 04:58.309
2,

04:58.660 --> 05:00.011
and SPIRIT.

05:00.156 --> 05:01.103
Nice, everybody.

05:01.222 --> 05:03.131
Up next, we're going to do some
swings.

05:03.196 --> 05:06.667
We're going to do some leg
swings and some arm swings.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.279
So here's the leg swings.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.575
If you want to do the arm
swings, you can follow along

05:12.586 --> 05:13.939
with Avery.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.869
There it is right there.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.029
Getting those legs and arms up.

05:24.060 --> 05:27.849
Getting a nice reach, everybody,
so let's get to it.

05:28.540 --> 05:29.989
Good work, Marcela.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.139
Good job, everyone.

05:42.290 --> 05:43.389
Keep it going.

05:48.740 --> 05:49.449
5,

05:50.050 --> 05:50.819
4,

05:51.290 --> 05:52.119
3,

05:52.560 --> 05:53.299
2,

05:53.620 --> 05:54.971
and SPIRIT.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.229
Awesome.

05:56.340 --> 05:58.769
All right, we're going to get
into a little bit of cardio so

05:58.780 --> 06:00.447
we can get our heart rates up.

06:00.534 --> 06:04.059
So what we're going to do next,
everybody, is some jump rope.

06:04.220 --> 06:07.729
Let's get those invisible jump
ropes out.

06:08.180 --> 06:09.649
Get a bounce going.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.089
Let's move it.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.709
Good job, everybody.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.635
All right.

06:28.738 --> 06:30.139
Nice, Avery.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.179
Good job, Marcela.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.791
All right, you all, we're
almost there.

06:45.846 --> 06:47.371
We got 15 seconds.

06:47.436 --> 06:49.839
Let's see if we can move it a
little faster.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.135
Awesome.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.789
We got 5,

07:06.160 --> 07:06.899
4,

07:07.280 --> 07:08.069
3,

07:08.410 --> 07:09.239
2,

07:09.442 --> 07:10.695
and SPIRIT.

07:10.808 --> 07:13.069
All right, keep that bounce
going, everybody.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.779
Up next we're going to run in
place.

07:16.850 --> 07:20.827
So we're keeping our bounce
going, but we're going to pump

07:20.838 --> 07:23.855
our arms to go along with it.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.649
So we're just running in place.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.809
If you have some space, you can
go side to side,

07:32.440 --> 07:33.669
forward and back.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.547
All right.

07:42.634 --> 07:47.879
Nice arm swing, Avery, keep
those arms pumping.

07:55.100 --> 07:55.719
All right.

07:55.790 --> 07:56.803
Nice, Marcela.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.155
Let's double time, everybody.

07:58.258 --> 08:00.059
Faster, faster, faster.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.167
All right, so up next, we're
going to do a little bit of

08:06.178 --> 08:07.191
speedbag.

08:07.256 --> 08:09.869
So we're going to keep the
bounce going, but we're going

08:09.869 --> 08:14.260
to roll one hand over the other
as fast as we can, just like we

08:14.260 --> 08:16.080
would if we're hitting the
speedbag.

08:17.730 --> 08:18.649
Let's do it.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.269
You can go up, down, side to
side,

08:24.360 --> 08:25.929
just keep those hands rolling.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.274
Good job, everybody.

08:36.457 --> 08:37.779
10 seconds.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.038
Look at those quick hands from
Avery.

08:43.020 --> 08:43.928
Good job.

08:46.930 --> 08:47.689
5,

08:48.270 --> 08:49.139
4,

08:49.470 --> 08:50.349
3,

08:50.740 --> 08:51.609
2,

08:51.920 --> 08:53.919
and SPIRIT.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.275
Excellent, everybody.

08:55.378 --> 08:56.427
Good job, Marcela.

08:56.514 --> 08:57.831
Good job, Avery.

08:57.976 --> 09:00.849
All right, you all, we're going
to take ourselves a quick break.

09:02.110 --> 09:06.169
While we're taking our break,
you all can get yourself set up

09:06.180 --> 09:10.319
by having water, of course, so
you can stay hydrated.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.899
Keep a chair nearby just so you
can rest up in between our

09:13.910 --> 09:14.495
breaks.

09:14.528 --> 09:17.845
And if you do have boxing
gloves, you can get those laced

09:17.856 --> 09:18.629
up now.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.475
And we're going to start in
about 30 seconds, everybody.

09:23.578 --> 09:25.449
Good job with the warm up.

09:26.140 --> 09:29.063
Hope you all are feeling fired
up and ready to go.

09:29.182 --> 09:30.889
We're going to have some fun
today.

09:31.660 --> 09:33.769
That was a great warm up.

09:35.100 --> 09:35.607
Nice.

09:35.694 --> 09:36.823
Yes, it was.

09:37.022 --> 09:38.519
The music helped.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.909
Yeah, definitely.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.989
All right, Marcela, Avery, are
we ready to go?

09:47.440 --> 09:48.299
Ready to go.

09:48.370 --> 09:48.939
Ready.

09:49.090 --> 09:50.363
Let's do it.

09:50.562 --> 09:54.209
All right, you all, so here we
go.

09:55.380 --> 09:58.411
First thing we're going to do,
everybody, we're going to start

09:58.422 --> 10:01.851
it off with a little general
exercise so we can get a little

10:01.862 --> 10:06.335
bit more warmed up, get our
body nice and fluid.

10:06.368 --> 10:08.607
So we're going to start off
with some floor touches.

10:08.624 --> 10:11.007
So we're going to reach those
hands up high, and then we're

10:11.018 --> 10:13.699
reaching them down towards the
floor.

10:14.600 --> 10:17.071
And even if you can't touch the
floor, just reach those

10:17.082 --> 10:20.559
fingertips as close as you can
and try to get a little closer

10:20.570 --> 10:21.491
each time.

10:21.546 --> 10:23.459
So we're going up and down.

10:23.530 --> 10:24.469
Let's do it.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.109
Good work, Marcela.

10:37.110 --> 10:38.529
Good job, Avery.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.939
Awesome, everybody out there,
keep it going.

10:51.590 --> 10:53.339
We've got 10 seconds.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.109
5,

10:59.610 --> 11:00.379
4,

11:00.730 --> 11:01.549
3,

11:01.900 --> 11:02.729
2,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.223
and SPIRIT.

11:04.352 --> 11:05.459
Awesome, everybody.

11:05.610 --> 11:07.283
All right, we're going to
change gears now.

11:07.322 --> 11:09.067
We're going into boxing mode.

11:09.184 --> 11:11.143
So let's get those hands up.

11:11.182 --> 11:13.527
The back hand is going to be
covering the face.

11:13.694 --> 11:15.671
The front is going to cover the
body.

11:15.806 --> 11:17.603
If you're doing this one
standing, you're going to have

11:17.614 --> 11:18.895
a staggered stance.

11:18.948 --> 11:20.491
One foot in front of the other.

11:20.626 --> 11:23.735
And we're just going to get a
nice bounce going while we're

11:23.746 --> 11:26.059
in our boxing stance.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.589
All right, so let's do it.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.009
Move around a little bit,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.479
find your rhythm.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.879
All right, there's Avery.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.335
He's feeling it.

11:40.358 --> 11:41.583
He's got those hands up.

11:41.622 --> 11:42.869
He's ready for anything.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.589
Marcela, same thing.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.483
She's ready to go.

11:50.522 --> 11:52.303
So let's do it, everybody,
first punch.

11:52.352 --> 11:55.311
We're going to start off with
our right jab.

11:55.376 --> 11:58.611
So we're just throwing a
straightforward punch and then

11:58.622 --> 12:02.649
back into our stance with the
hands up.

12:04.780 --> 12:07.399
So quick right jab.

12:12.540 --> 12:16.009
And as you're throwing those
punches, make sure you lean

12:16.009 --> 12:19.500
into them to get more power,
get better balance.

12:20.660 --> 12:22.399
Let's see it, Marcela.

12:23.220 --> 12:23.775
Nice.

12:23.878 --> 12:24.769
Good job.

12:26.260 --> 12:28.559
Way to step into those punches.

12:30.900 --> 12:34.069
All right, let's switch it up
to the left jab, everybody.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.887
Left jab.

12:35.984 --> 12:36.869
Let's go.

12:39.720 --> 12:43.375
All right, there's Avery with
those blazing flash jabs.

12:43.568 --> 12:44.469
Good job.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.107
Good work, everybody.

12:51.194 --> 12:52.339
Let's bring the two together.

12:52.410 --> 12:56.709
Now we're going right and left
jab back to back.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.189
Good job, everybody.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.799
Right and left.

13:16.300 --> 13:16.659
All right.

13:16.660 --> 13:18.475
We change it up in the other
direction.

13:18.508 --> 13:20.495
We'll go left and right.

13:20.598 --> 13:22.819
We'll go back and forth between
the two.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.069
Leading with the left, leading
with the right.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.219
Awesome, Marcela.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.729
All right, everybody, we got 5,

13:39.320 --> 13:40.089
4,

13:40.570 --> 13:41.379
3,

13:41.980 --> 13:42.859
2,

13:43.180 --> 13:44.859
and SPIRIT.

13:44.868 --> 13:46.089
Nice work.

13:46.460 --> 13:49.523
All right, we've got one more
thing before we move along.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.303
We're going to take the floor
touch and the jabs and we're

13:53.303 --> 13:56.676
going to put the two together
just so we can work on some

13:56.676 --> 14:00.604
coordination, being able to
switch gears in an instant.

14:00.652 --> 14:05.195
So we're going to touch our
toes, pop up, one, two jab.

14:05.388 --> 14:08.879
Floor touch, quick, jab, jab.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.389
Awesome, everybody.

14:21.480 --> 14:25.299
Floor touch, pop up, jab, jab.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.391
There you go, Avery.

14:27.466 --> 14:28.329
Nice work.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.855
All right, let's take it a step
further, everybody.

14:32.958 --> 14:36.359
Floor touch, pop up, four jabs,

14:38.000 --> 14:39.469
1, 2, 3, 4.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.079
And a little bit more quickness
with those punches.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.029
Let's go.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.203
Good job, Marcela.

14:51.272 --> 14:51.889
10,

14:52.260 --> 14:53.103
9,

14:53.302 --> 14:54.049
GREAT!

14:54.500 --> 14:55.149
7,

14:55.380 --> 14:56.199
6,

14:56.580 --> 14:57.389
5,

14:57.680 --> 14:58.479
4,

14:58.800 --> 14:59.599
3,

14:59.960 --> 15:00.799
2,

15:01.062 --> 15:02.539
and SPIRIT.

15:02.700 --> 15:03.969
Way to go, everybody.

15:04.660 --> 15:05.535
Great job.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.659
Alright, we're gonna pass it
along to Avery.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.839
He's going to lead us with the
next segment.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.191
All right, Kristian, what we're
going to start off doing this

15:12.191 --> 15:14.119
time around, we're going to
start off doing some shoulder

15:14.119 --> 15:14.784
presses.

15:14.832 --> 15:18.629
We're going to get about a good
30 seconds in of just pressing

15:18.629 --> 15:19.430
up,

15:20.040 --> 15:21.589
like raising the roof.

15:21.900 --> 15:24.569
Let's get about 30 seconds in
of this, okay?

15:29.440 --> 15:30.363
Just like that.

15:30.402 --> 15:31.229
Great job.

15:35.110 --> 15:36.269
There's Marcela.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.539
Great job, Marcela.

15:40.260 --> 15:42.049
Kristian raising the roof.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.799
Already feeling the burn.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.967
All right, we're about 15
seconds in.

15:48.134 --> 15:49.439
Let's finish it out strong.

15:49.510 --> 15:51.009
Let's pick it up a little bit.

16:02.760 --> 16:03.739
All right, 5,

16:04.090 --> 16:04.909
4,

16:05.070 --> 16:05.859
3,

16:06.310 --> 16:07.159
2,

16:07.306 --> 16:08.679
and SPIRIT.

16:09.420 --> 16:10.631
All right, great job.

16:10.686 --> 16:12.843
With that, we're going to jump
right back into our boxing

16:12.843 --> 16:13.572
stance.

16:13.716 --> 16:17.027
This time around, we're going
to start off just throwing some

16:17.038 --> 16:18.429
right hook punches, okay?

16:27.520 --> 16:29.789
And remember, when you're
throwing this hook punch, you

16:29.800 --> 16:33.803
want to follow through all the
way across the front of your

16:33.814 --> 16:34.719
chest.

16:46.260 --> 16:47.759
Great job, Kristian.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.509
All right, we're going to
switch to our left,

16:54.520 --> 16:57.049
just left hook punches only.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.719
Great job, Marcela.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.943
All right, let's get a few more
in and then we're going to put

17:11.954 --> 17:13.068
them both together.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.019
All right, let's put them both
together.

17:21.089 --> 17:22.749
That's going to be a right and
a left.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.749
Great job transitioning, guys.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.509
Keep it up.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.119
Great job, everyone.

17:48.190 --> 17:49.049
Keep going.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.051
Don't stop.

18:01.106 --> 18:01.947
Don't think about it.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.559
Just keep throwing those
punches.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.317
All right, let's get ready to
put four of them together,

18:13.317 --> 18:14.110
everyone.

18:15.080 --> 18:15.899
So it's going to be

18:15.900 --> 18:16.269
1,

18:16.270 --> 18:16.759
2,

18:16.760 --> 18:17.209
3,

18:17.210 --> 18:17.779
4.

18:19.550 --> 18:21.339
Four quick hook punches.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.339
Great job, Marcela.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.289
All right, let's go for 30
seconds, let's finish it out.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.619
And remember, you want to reset
after you throw your punches.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.831
Hands back up, four punches.

18:57.976 --> 19:00.379
Hands up, four punches.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.415
All right, we got 10,

19:10.598 --> 19:11.423
9,

19:11.622 --> 19:12.369
GREAT!

19:12.760 --> 19:13.409
7,

19:13.840 --> 19:14.649
6,

19:14.940 --> 19:15.699
5,

19:16.040 --> 19:16.949
4,

19:17.120 --> 19:17.959
3,

19:18.280 --> 19:19.079
2,

19:19.570 --> 19:21.139
and SPIRIT.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.203
All right, great job, everyone.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.163
Before I pass it along to
Marcela, we're going to jump

19:26.174 --> 19:29.043
right back into our shoulder
presses, and we're going to

19:29.054 --> 19:30.759
incorporate hook punches.

19:32.940 --> 19:36.919
Let's say five chest presses,
and then we're going to throw

19:36.919 --> 19:38.616
four hook punches.

19:38.648 --> 19:39.035
Okay?

19:39.160 --> 19:40.079
So 1,

19:40.080 --> 19:40.569
2,

19:40.570 --> 19:41.139
3,

19:41.150 --> 19:41.709
4,

19:41.710 --> 19:42.309
5,

19:42.700 --> 19:43.229
1,

19:43.230 --> 19:43.619
2,

19:43.620 --> 19:44.069
3,

19:44.070 --> 19:44.599
4.

19:45.100 --> 19:45.699
1,

19:45.700 --> 19:46.129
2.

19:46.160 --> 19:46.639
3,

19:46.640 --> 19:47.139
4,

19:47.140 --> 19:47.759
5,

19:48.090 --> 19:48.749
1,

19:48.890 --> 19:49.389
2,

19:49.390 --> 19:49.779
3,

19:49.780 --> 19:50.209
4.

19:50.466 --> 19:51.329
All right?

19:58.740 --> 19:59.791
Great job, everyone.

19:59.846 --> 20:00.769
Keep it up.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.095
Nice combination, Avery.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.249
Feeling it.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.169
All right, we got 10,

20:18.540 --> 20:19.289
9,

20:20.060 --> 20:20.855
GREAT!

20:21.040 --> 20:21.719
7,

20:22.070 --> 20:22.649
6,

20:23.160 --> 20:23.969
5,

20:24.180 --> 20:24.909
4,

20:25.410 --> 20:26.209
3,

20:26.640 --> 20:27.449
2,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.499
and SPIRIT.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.869
Awesome job, everyone.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.687
Now I'll pass it along to
Marcela and see what she has up

20:35.698 --> 20:36.269
next.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.403
All right.

20:37.442 --> 20:38.423
Thank you, Avery.

20:38.552 --> 20:42.599
Okay, our next target movement
is going to be our jumping jacks.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.607
So I'm going to be doing the
standing version, which is I'm

20:45.618 --> 20:48.619
going to tap to the side, bring
my arms overhead

20:49.600 --> 20:50.829
right in the middle.

20:52.980 --> 20:55.264
If you're doing the advanced
version, you can follow along

20:55.264 --> 20:56.580
with Kristian.

21:01.030 --> 21:02.209
Nice.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.869
Nice work.

21:10.990 --> 21:12.269
Good job, Avery.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.459
Keep it going for 20 seconds.

21:32.960 --> 21:33.709
10,

21:34.160 --> 21:34.955
9,

21:35.138 --> 21:35.963
GREAT!

21:36.162 --> 21:36.909
7,

21:37.150 --> 21:37.819
6,

21:38.340 --> 21:39.099
5,

21:39.380 --> 21:40.089
4,

21:40.360 --> 21:41.019
3,

21:41.550 --> 21:42.269
2,

21:42.810 --> 21:44.809
and SPIRIT.

21:45.010 --> 21:45.889
Awesome.

21:46.040 --> 21:46.869
All right,

21:48.440 --> 21:51.231
we're going to do our uppercut,
so we're going to start with

21:51.242 --> 21:52.979
the right uppercut.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.687
You're going to lean on the leg
that is in front of you and

21:56.698 --> 22:00.543
bring that uppercut all the way
through your hips.

22:00.672 --> 22:01.989
All the way through.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.469
So let's do it.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.349
Right uppercuts.

22:13.310 --> 22:14.149
Just like that.

22:14.150 --> 22:15.019
Very good.

22:32.700 --> 22:33.809
Good, Avery.

22:38.270 --> 22:40.999
Okay, let's do our left
uppercuts.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.399
Left.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.989
Good job, everyone.

22:55.710 --> 22:56.789
Keep it going.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.669
All right, let's do them
together.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.409
Right, left, right, left
uppercuts.

23:10.270 --> 23:11.519
All right, let's go.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.169
Right and left, good job.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.179
Good work, Avery.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.259
Excellent.

23:39.580 --> 23:42.119
Keep it going for 20 more
seconds.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.389
10,

23:53.700 --> 23:54.409
9,

23:54.730 --> 23:55.559
GREAT!

23:55.930 --> 23:56.669
7,

23:57.080 --> 23:57.939
6,

23:58.300 --> 23:58.959
5,

23:59.530 --> 24:00.359
4,

24:00.700 --> 24:01.519
3,

24:02.260 --> 24:02.849
2,

24:03.680 --> 24:05.419
and SPIRIT.

24:05.622 --> 24:07.279
All right, keep moving, guys.

24:07.350 --> 24:11.627
We are going to add the jumping
jack to our punches, so we're

24:11.638 --> 24:14.639
going to do two jumping jacks,
two uppercuts.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.549
So let's try this.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.389
That's 1,

24:19.520 --> 24:20.249
2,

24:20.520 --> 24:21.759
uppercut, uppercut.

24:21.910 --> 24:22.749
1,

24:23.940 --> 24:24.679
2,

24:25.720 --> 24:27.269
uppercut, uppercut.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.349
There you go.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.869
Uppercut,

24:37.110 --> 24:38.179
jumping jacks.

24:42.430 --> 24:43.299
Nice.

24:46.770 --> 24:48.069
Good job, Kristian.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.739
Awesome, Avery.

25:05.830 --> 25:06.799
Nice work.

25:16.780 --> 25:17.489
10,

25:18.100 --> 25:18.939
9,

25:19.640 --> 25:20.429
GREAT!

25:21.280 --> 25:22.029
7,

25:22.430 --> 25:23.269
6,

25:24.350 --> 25:25.139
5,

25:26.360 --> 25:27.069
4,

25:28.200 --> 25:28.989
3,

25:30.160 --> 25:30.839
2,

25:31.660 --> 25:34.239
and SPIRIT.

25:35.570 --> 25:36.719
Great job.

25:39.700 --> 25:40.543
All right.

25:40.662 --> 25:42.491
Amazing stuff, Marcela.

25:42.556 --> 25:43.403
Good job, Avery.

25:43.452 --> 25:44.529
Good job, everybody.

25:45.220 --> 25:46.319
Awesome work.

25:46.390 --> 25:50.459
That was not easy combining
those exercises with the punches.

25:50.620 --> 25:52.129
Let's go get some water.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.389
Good job, everyone.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.739
Oh, man, that was tough.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.339
Coordination.

26:06.700 --> 26:07.769
Was it easy?

26:08.300 --> 26:09.529
Not at all.

26:10.140 --> 26:12.243
But we did it, Marcela and
Avery, we made it through

26:12.254 --> 26:13.609
everybody, so

26:15.020 --> 26:15.863
we win.

26:15.982 --> 26:18.839
But there's more to come,
everybody, so good job.

26:18.990 --> 26:20.563
That was our first round.

26:20.612 --> 26:23.127
Before we officially take a
break, we're going to pick

26:23.138 --> 26:26.871
ourselves back up and get ready
for our challenge, where we're

26:26.882 --> 26:29.927
going to do 1 minute of an
exercise, and our goal is to

26:29.938 --> 26:33.163
get as many reps of that
exercise as we can.

26:33.202 --> 26:36.969
So what we're going to do is
we're going to do a little side

26:36.980 --> 26:40.111
punching, so you can do this
three different ways.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.959
We got the seated version, we
got Marcela

26:43.720 --> 26:44.899
with the baseline,

26:45.640 --> 26:47.763
and you can do it with me.

26:47.802 --> 26:50.629
So what I'll be doing is a side
step

26:51.240 --> 26:52.419
with a punch.

26:52.760 --> 26:55.855
Side step, punch, punch.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.903
So you're punching to the left
and the right.

26:59.022 --> 27:00.967
You can pick which punch you
want to do.

27:01.054 --> 27:04.889
You can do the jab, you can do
the hook, or the upper cut.

27:05.580 --> 27:09.097
So you're just turning your
body to the side, throwing two

27:09.108 --> 27:11.963
punches, same thing on the
other side.

27:12.162 --> 27:15.176
All right, so each side that
you do, that's going to count

27:15.176 --> 27:16.270
as one.

27:17.520 --> 27:20.603
So in 10 seconds, we're going
to get started and try to get

27:20.614 --> 27:22.479
in as many as we can.

27:22.550 --> 27:25.583
So everybody get into your
stance, get that bounce going.

27:25.702 --> 27:26.769
Let's get ready.

27:31.620 --> 27:32.739
And here we go.

27:32.810 --> 27:33.663
Side punches

27:33.712 --> 27:34.275
in 3,

27:34.378 --> 27:34.883
2,

27:35.002 --> 27:35.427
1,

27:35.514 --> 27:36.549
let's do it.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.869
Nice shot, Marcela.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.099
Good work, Avery.

28:00.640 --> 28:03.629
Awesome job, everybody, keep it
going.

28:13.660 --> 28:16.019
30 seconds, almost there.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.029
20, keep it going, everybody.

28:30.760 --> 28:33.299
Let's try to push a little bit
harder.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.049
10,

28:39.420 --> 28:40.169
9,

28:40.540 --> 28:41.289
GREAT!

28:41.740 --> 28:42.409
7,

28:42.710 --> 28:43.619
6,

28:44.070 --> 28:44.899
5,

28:45.260 --> 28:46.149
4,

28:46.340 --> 28:47.139
3,

28:47.520 --> 28:48.429
2,

28:48.700 --> 28:50.299
and SPIRIT.

28:50.300 --> 28:51.943
Awesome job, everybody.

28:52.142 --> 28:54.199
Good work, Marcela and Avery.

28:55.440 --> 28:58.631
All right, on that note, let's
go take a break, so pull up

28:58.642 --> 28:59.747
those chairs.

28:59.864 --> 29:02.251
We're going to get about a
minute of resting before we

29:02.262 --> 29:05.809
pick it back up for round
number two.

29:06.180 --> 29:07.311
Way to go, everybody.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.529
Awesome job.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.249
All right, that was fun.

29:17.620 --> 29:20.751
Worked our way through all
three of our punches.

29:20.816 --> 29:24.149
Got a little cardio exercise in
there.

29:25.960 --> 29:29.553
So next step, we're going to
work on some defensive moves

29:29.553 --> 29:33.400
and bring those together to go
along with the punches.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.687
Avery and Marcela, do you two
have a favorite punch of the

29:43.698 --> 29:44.429
three?

29:46.480 --> 29:48.299
I like the jab punch.

29:48.670 --> 29:50.449
Jab punch, okay.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.329
Marcela, which one do you like?

29:53.780 --> 29:55.215
I like it all.

29:55.398 --> 29:56.063
All of them?

29:56.102 --> 29:58.719
Okay, you just like to throw
punches?

29:59.140 --> 29:59.889
Yes.

30:01.540 --> 30:02.629
How about you?

30:04.600 --> 30:07.299
I like the upper cut, I like
the power punch.

30:10.200 --> 30:16.575
Jab is fun, hook is good, but
the upper cut, just bring all

30:16.586 --> 30:19.849
your energy together, and one
boom, that's it, done.

30:20.300 --> 30:23.175
The jab punch is kind of like a
surprising punch, though, right?

30:23.198 --> 30:25.449
So you can snap it real quick,

30:27.920 --> 30:28.909
catch them.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.803
And you don't have to use too
much energy either.

30:31.922 --> 30:32.589
Yeah.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.869
All right, everybody, if you've
got a favorite punch out there,

30:40.720 --> 30:42.619
let us know in the chat.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.775
All right, here we go.

30:45.798 --> 30:47.215
So let's get back into it.

30:47.238 --> 30:50.171
We're going to do round number
two now, and as I said, we're

30:50.182 --> 30:53.247
going to add in some defense to
go along with the moves that we

30:53.258 --> 30:54.275
already worked on.

30:54.378 --> 30:55.411
So let's get to it.

30:55.466 --> 30:57.829
First things first, we're going
to get into our boxing stance,

30:57.829 --> 31:00.470
get those hands up, get that
bounce going.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.591
All right, our first defensive
move, we're going to start off

31:06.602 --> 31:07.843
with the shoulder roll.

31:07.892 --> 31:12.033
So for the shoulder roll, we're
just leaning side to side,

31:12.033 --> 31:14.184
rolling those shoulders left to
right.

31:14.300 --> 31:17.075
Just imagine there's a punch
coming towards your face and

31:17.086 --> 31:20.471
you've got to avoid that punch,
so roll your shoulders as quick

31:20.482 --> 31:23.199
as you can so you don't get hit.

31:23.760 --> 31:24.909
Let's go.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.429
There's Avery doing a great job

31:29.040 --> 31:32.799
with the quick side to side
movement, avoiding those punches.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.155
Good work, everybody.

31:42.278 --> 31:43.987
So we practiced left to right.

31:44.074 --> 31:46.389
Let's do the same thing right
to left.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.447
Awesome, Marcela.

31:48.544 --> 31:50.339
Way to add in the footwork.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.810
All right, everybody, we're
going to keep those shoulder

31:57.810 --> 32:02.227
rolls going, but we're going to
add two jabs and then shoulder

32:02.228 --> 32:02.656
rolls.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.727
So we're going left, right jab,
following it up with the

32:05.738 --> 32:07.139
shoulder rolls.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.149
Good work, everybody.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.889
Jab, jab, shoulder roll.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.675
As Avery mentioned earlier,
after you finish your

32:21.686 --> 32:23.729
combination, make sure you reset.

32:23.814 --> 32:25.327
Get those hands back up.

32:25.414 --> 32:27.567
Cover your face and your body.

32:27.654 --> 32:28.959
Stay protected.

32:30.660 --> 32:31.711
Awesome work, Avery.

32:31.766 --> 32:33.279
Good job, Marcela.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.559
All right, we're going to take
it a step further, everybody.

32:36.630 --> 32:38.015
We're going to add in another
punch.

32:38.048 --> 32:40.927
So we're still keeping our jab,
jab, shoulder roll, but we're

32:40.938 --> 32:43.171
going to add in two hooks at
the end.

32:43.226 --> 32:46.819
So jab, jab, shoulder roll,
shoulder roll, hook, hook.

32:47.980 --> 32:48.969
Let's go.

32:51.420 --> 32:53.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

32:54.060 --> 32:55.223
Nice job with those.

32:55.262 --> 32:56.359
Quick punches.

32:56.860 --> 32:58.619
Quick shoulder rolls.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.675
Awesome, everybody.

33:03.778 --> 33:04.909
We got 10,

33:05.280 --> 33:06.029
9,

33:06.400 --> 33:07.149
GREAT!

33:07.600 --> 33:08.229
7,

33:08.530 --> 33:09.459
6,

33:09.690 --> 33:10.499
5,

33:10.890 --> 33:11.729
4,

33:11.950 --> 33:12.749
3,

33:13.090 --> 33:13.979
2,

33:14.340 --> 33:16.079
and SPIRIT.

33:16.660 --> 33:17.855
Way to go, everybody.

33:17.958 --> 33:18.849
Good job.

33:19.540 --> 33:20.507
All right, Avery's

33:20.524 --> 33:22.849
going to show us our next move.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.563
All right, Kristian, our next
defensive move that we're going

33:25.574 --> 33:27.663
to practice here today is going
to be the duck.

33:27.792 --> 33:28.115
All right?

33:28.138 --> 33:31.989
So if you're doing it seated
like myself, it's sort of like a

33:32.600 --> 33:33.631
seated crunch.

33:33.696 --> 33:35.283
So I'm just going to duck like
this.

33:35.322 --> 33:36.655
My hands are still going to be
up.

33:36.700 --> 33:39.269
My head is going to be up so I
can see.

33:39.420 --> 33:40.871
I'm going to duck like this.

33:40.926 --> 33:43.091
Okay, let's just practice.

33:43.236 --> 33:46.569
You can check out Marcela and
Kristian if you're standing to

33:46.580 --> 33:47.755
follow along with them.

33:47.778 --> 33:48.349
Okay?

33:52.640 --> 33:54.299
Great job, Marcela.

33:57.040 --> 33:59.191
Remember, when you're ducking,
you still want to keep your

33:59.202 --> 34:00.369
guard up.

34:02.820 --> 34:05.707
Sometimes when you duck, that's
when you get caught with that

34:05.718 --> 34:07.211
uppercut, Kristian.

34:07.356 --> 34:08.289
Oh, yeah.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.009
Hands up, everybody.

34:13.719 --> 34:14.709
Great job.

34:18.360 --> 34:21.036
All right, let's rock this out
for about another 20 seconds,

34:21.036 --> 34:23.219
and then we're going to add
some punches.

34:30.300 --> 34:31.319
Great work, everyone.

34:31.389 --> 34:32.329
Keep it up.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.171
All right.

34:38.226 --> 34:38.923
10,

34:39.121 --> 34:39.869
9,

34:40.320 --> 34:41.069
GREAT!

34:41.440 --> 34:42.169
7,

34:42.489 --> 34:43.218
6,

34:43.830 --> 34:44.549
5,

34:44.989 --> 34:45.849
4,

34:46.210 --> 34:46.999
3,

34:47.550 --> 34:48.249
2,

34:48.639 --> 34:49.959
and SPIRIT.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.138
All right, we're still going to
keep our guards up.

34:52.210 --> 34:53.959
We're still practicing our duck.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.246
Now, this time around, we're
going to duck, and then we're

34:56.257 --> 34:59.143
going to throw a right hook and
a left hook.

34:59.190 --> 35:02.999
Okay, so we're going to duck,
right, left.

35:03.080 --> 35:06.649
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

35:06.710 --> 35:09.759
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

35:13.390 --> 35:15.429
Great job transitioning,
everyone.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.179
Good work, Kristian.

35:30.470 --> 35:31.369
Excellent.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.139
Great job, Marcela.

35:40.660 --> 35:42.399
All right, 20 seconds.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.947
All right, let's finish it out
strong, everyone.

35:57.034 --> 35:57.669
10,

35:58.200 --> 35:58.949
9,

35:59.400 --> 36:00.149
GREAT!

36:00.760 --> 36:01.489
7,

36:01.920 --> 36:02.649
6,

36:03.470 --> 36:04.269
5,

36:04.980 --> 36:05.829
4,

36:06.460 --> 36:07.359
3,

36:08.040 --> 36:08.889
2,

36:09.180 --> 36:10.595
and SPIRIT.

36:10.708 --> 36:14.115
All right, we're going to keep
that same process going, but

36:14.126 --> 36:15.575
this time we're going to

36:15.660 --> 36:20.649
duck, hook, hook, duck again,
right uppercut, left uppercut.

36:20.706 --> 36:22.859
Okay, so that's going to be a
duck,

36:23.360 --> 36:25.879
hook, hook, another duck,

36:26.040 --> 36:27.387
uppercut, upper cut.

36:27.474 --> 36:28.109
Okay?

36:28.800 --> 36:33.799
Duck, hook, hook, duck again,
uppercut, uppercut.

36:33.890 --> 36:34.239
Great.

36:34.310 --> 36:35.329
Just like that.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.399
30 seconds.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.589
Let's knock it out.

36:48.520 --> 36:49.299
Literally.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.219
Great work, Kristian.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.119
Great job, Marcela.

37:05.420 --> 37:07.319
All right, 15 seconds.

37:15.520 --> 37:16.091
All right.

37:16.146 --> 37:16.843
10,

37:17.042 --> 37:17.789
9,

37:18.240 --> 37:18.989
GREAT!

37:19.540 --> 37:20.379
7,

37:20.610 --> 37:21.319
6,

37:21.920 --> 37:22.629
5,

37:23.240 --> 37:23.999
4,

37:24.540 --> 37:25.309
3,

37:26.140 --> 37:26.969
2,

37:27.380 --> 37:28.959
and SPIRIT.

37:30.020 --> 37:31.087
Great work, everyone.

37:31.174 --> 37:32.143
Great work.

37:32.342 --> 37:34.849
All right, Marcela, what do you
have for us next?

37:35.220 --> 37:38.419
All right, our next defense
move is going to be the block.

37:38.540 --> 37:42.590
So for this one, try to bring
those elbows together right in

37:42.602 --> 37:44.629
front of our face to protect.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.383
So we're going to start first
with our blocks.

37:48.512 --> 37:50.099
Side to side blocks.

37:53.160 --> 37:53.619
Again.

37:53.690 --> 37:54.869
Just like that.

38:02.640 --> 38:03.709
Very good.

38:08.710 --> 38:09.799
Good job, Kristian.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.619
Nice, Avery.

38:26.520 --> 38:29.903
We're going to keep going with
this block, and we're going to

38:29.914 --> 38:32.419
add some punches to the block.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.939
Let's do that for another 10
seconds,

38:36.600 --> 38:37.339
9,

38:37.900 --> 38:38.709
GREAT!

38:39.150 --> 38:39.919
7,

38:40.430 --> 38:41.259
6,

38:41.660 --> 38:42.429
5,

38:42.890 --> 38:43.689
4,

38:44.150 --> 38:44.909
3,

38:45.500 --> 38:46.259
2,

38:46.540 --> 38:48.359
and SPIRIT.

38:48.540 --> 38:50.507
Good job, everyone, keep moving.

38:50.674 --> 38:52.555
Time for our uppercuts.

38:52.660 --> 38:56.239
So we're going to do a block,
uppercut, uppercut.

38:57.060 --> 38:59.549
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

39:02.260 --> 39:03.239
Nice.

39:03.380 --> 39:05.709
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

39:10.110 --> 39:11.079
Excellent.

39:19.080 --> 39:19.839
Block,

39:20.840 --> 39:21.919
and uppercuts.

39:22.410 --> 39:23.719
Looking good, Avery.

39:23.720 --> 39:24.629
Good job.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.879
Nice, Kristian.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.009
Good job, Marcela.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.309
Get ready to add another punch.

39:40.800 --> 39:41.759
So we're going to do

39:41.760 --> 39:45.819
block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

39:46.260 --> 39:51.469
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

39:52.260 --> 39:55.739
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

39:55.800 --> 39:56.899
There we go.

40:04.230 --> 40:05.899
A lot to think in here.

40:07.980 --> 40:09.049
Nice work.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.209
Good job, Kristian.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.829
Nice, keep it up, keep it up,
almost there.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.179
10,

40:26.020 --> 40:26.789
9,

40:27.510 --> 40:28.299
GREAT!

40:28.800 --> 40:29.589
7,

40:29.940 --> 40:30.789
6,

40:31.370 --> 40:32.099
5,

40:33.000 --> 40:33.819
4,

40:34.330 --> 40:35.099
3,

40:37.780 --> 40:39.379
SPIRIT.

40:40.990 --> 40:42.199
Awesome.

40:43.060 --> 40:43.919
All right.

40:44.070 --> 40:46.011
Way to go, Marcela.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.689
Way to go, Avery.

40:48.908 --> 40:51.151
That was a real workout,
everybody.

40:51.286 --> 40:52.483
Good job.

40:52.522 --> 40:54.869
Let's go get another quick sip
of water.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.587
All right, congratulations,
everybody.

41:03.674 --> 41:07.375
We made it to the finish line,
and we did it with style.

41:07.488 --> 41:09.735
You all did an amazing job
today.

41:09.918 --> 41:12.146
So what we're going to do next,
we're going to finish it off

41:12.158 --> 41:15.186
with some cool down stretches
so we can relax all those

41:15.198 --> 41:17.879
muscles that we fired up today.

41:18.030 --> 41:20.983
Our first stretch, we're going
to start off with the side bend.

41:21.032 --> 41:22.103
We're going to get our core.

41:22.152 --> 41:24.279
We did a lot of twisting and
turning.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.469
We're going to

41:26.080 --> 41:31.125
help those muscles relax by
bringing one arm up and over

41:31.125 --> 41:33.250
and leaning to the opposite side.

41:34.260 --> 41:36.399
We'll hold it for 10 seconds

41:37.140 --> 41:38.619
and then switch.

41:43.720 --> 41:44.467
3,

41:44.634 --> 41:45.395
2,

41:45.578 --> 41:47.443
and switch it up.

41:47.562 --> 41:49.509
Same thing on the other side.

42:00.680 --> 42:01.409
5,

42:01.610 --> 42:02.409
4,

42:02.510 --> 42:03.249
3,

42:03.270 --> 42:04.079
2,

42:04.170 --> 42:05.003
and SPIRIT.

42:05.072 --> 42:05.543
Good job.

42:05.582 --> 42:07.282
Now we're going to take both
hands and we're going to reach

42:07.294 --> 42:10.551
them down towards the floor,
and we're going to hold it.

42:10.606 --> 42:13.670
If you're standing up, try to
keep those legs nice and

42:13.682 --> 42:14.619
straight.

42:17.760 --> 42:20.139
Reach down towards the floor.

42:28.020 --> 42:28.829
5,

42:29.010 --> 42:29.739
4,

42:29.940 --> 42:30.659
3,

42:30.830 --> 42:31.599
2,

42:31.670 --> 42:32.523
and SPIRIT.

42:32.572 --> 42:33.119
Good job.

42:33.190 --> 42:34.079
Last one, everybody.

42:34.150 --> 42:36.993
We're going to reach in the
opposite direction now, hands

42:36.993 --> 42:38.292
up above our head.

42:38.346 --> 42:41.155
Get those shoulders and arms
stretched out.

42:41.178 --> 42:43.316
If you want to get your lower
back in the mix, you could push

42:43.328 --> 42:45.369
your hips forward and lean back.

42:49.340 --> 42:51.943
And we'll hold it for 10,

42:52.142 --> 42:52.983
9,

42:53.182 --> 42:53.975
GREAT!

42:54.160 --> 42:54.929
7,

42:55.010 --> 42:55.879
6,

42:56.040 --> 42:56.759
5,

42:56.990 --> 42:57.769
4,

42:57.910 --> 42:58.649
3,

42:58.770 --> 42:59.539
2,

42:59.710 --> 43:01.519
and SPIRIT.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.549
Awesome job today, everybody.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.527
Great work, Avery.

43:05.544 --> 43:07.095
Good job, Marcela.

43:07.288 --> 43:09.415
Awesome work, Kristian and
Avery.

43:09.528 --> 43:12.055
And all of you, great job.

43:12.248 --> 43:13.403
Great job, everyone.

43:13.522 --> 43:14.615
Great work, Marcela.

43:14.648 --> 43:17.949
Great work, Kristian, awesome
class, love the energy.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.711
Lots of fun as always,
everybody, thank you all again

43:23.722 --> 43:25.971
for being a part of this thing
with us.

43:26.106 --> 43:28.803
We appreciate you, and we look
forward to seeing you next time.

43:28.840 --> 43:31.879
So everybody take care and we
will catch up with you soon.
