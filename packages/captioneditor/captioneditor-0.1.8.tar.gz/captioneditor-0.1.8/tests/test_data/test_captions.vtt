Thank you all for being here

00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:08.197
two amazing trainers who are
going to introduce themselves

7
00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:09.669
to you all.

8
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.675
Hello, everyone.

9
00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:13.447
My name is Marcela.

10
00:01:13.544 --> 00:01:16.139
Very happy to be here with you.

11
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.109
I hope you guys enjoy the class.

12
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.523
Hello, everyone.

13
00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:22.039
My name is Avery.

14
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.611
Thanks for joining us today.

15
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.735
Like Marcela said, I hope you
guys are ready for a great class.

16
00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:28.959
Let's jump right into it,
Kristian.

17
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.795
All right, let's do it, Avery.

18
00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:32.043
Let's do it, Marcela.

19
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:32.991
Let's go, everybody.

20
00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.776
So we're going to kick our
class off with some warm up

21
00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:39.509
exercises so we can get the
blood flowing, get our

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.339
body parts

23
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.703
ready for some action.

24
00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:47.007
All right, so first thing we're
going to start with everybody,

25
00:01:47.018 --> 00:01:48.735
we're just going to do some
side bends.

26
00:01:48.768 --> 00:01:51.603
So let's spread those arms out
to the side, and then we're

27
00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:54.050
going to lean left to right,
trying to reach those

28
00:01:54.062 --> 00:01:57.529
fingertips as close to the
floor as we can.

29
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.769
Here we go.

30
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.698
Good job, everybody.

31
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.859
Looking good, Avery and Marcela.

32
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.091
Make sure you all are reaching
those fingertips a little bit

33
00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:15.649
lower each time.

34
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.871
Good work, Avery.

35
00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:27.279
Good job, Marcela.

36
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.515
10 seconds, everybody.

37
00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:29.589
Keep it going.

38
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.239
5,

39
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.409
4,

40
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.379
3,

41
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.569
2,

42
00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:39.759
and SPIRIT.

43
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.419
Good job.

44
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.683
Next up, we're going to bring
our elbows up to our sides and

45
00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:45.719
we're going to twist left to
right.

46
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.763
This is our torso twist.

47
00:02:47.892 --> 00:02:51.421
We're going to open up our hips
and our midsections by twisting

48
00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:52.509
side to side.

49
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.629
Here we go.

50
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.649
Good job, everybody.

51
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.299
Nice work, Avery.

52
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.231
Excellent, Marcela.

53
00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.629
Keep it going, everybody.

54
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.331
All right, we're going to add
on to our twist with some

55
00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:25.779
punches so twist and punch.

56
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.649
Twist and punch.

57
00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:30.209
Everybody, let's go.

58
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.819
Good job.

59
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.651
We got 15 seconds.

60
00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:43.939
Let's go faster.

61
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.969
Pick it up.

62
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.099
5,

63
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.269
4,

64
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.469
3,

65
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.559
2,

66
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.135
and SPIRIT.

67
00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:01.339
Awesome, everybody.

68
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.451
All right, we're going to move
on to our arms next.

69
0:04:05.506 --> 0:04:08.846
So we're going to wrap our arms
up around our upper bodies,

70
0:04:08.846 --> 0:04:11.552
give ourselves a nice big
squeeze, and then we're going

71
0:04:11.552 --> 0:04:14.204
to pull them apart, big and wide.

72
00:04:14.332 --> 00:04:16.319
This is our SPIRIT fly.

73
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.149
Get our chest and shoulders
nice and ready.

74
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.515
All right.

75
00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:33.689
Nice stretch, Avery, way to
open those arms up.

76
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

77
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.583
All right, everybody, 10
seconds.

78
00:04:46.632 --> 00:04:49.819
Let's try to pull those arms
back further.

79
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.749
5,

80
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.989
4,

81
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.199
3,

82
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.309
2,

83
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.011
and SPIRIT.

84
00:05:00.156 --> 00:05:01.103
Nice, everybody.

85
00:05:01.222 --> 00:05:03.131
Up next, we're going to do some
swings.

86
00:05:03.196 --> 00:05:06.667
We're going to do some leg
swings and some arm swings.

87
00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:09.279
So here's the leg swings.

88
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.575
If you want to do the arm
swings, you can follow along

89
00:05:12.586 --> 00:05:13.939
with Avery.

90
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.869
There it is right there.

91
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.029
Getting those legs and arms up.

92
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.849
Getting a nice reach, everybody,
so let's get to it.

93
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.989
Good work, Marcela.

94
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.139
Good job, everyone.

95
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.389
Keep it going.

96
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.449
5,

97
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.819
4,

98
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.119
3,

99
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.299
2,

100
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.971
and SPIRIT.

101
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.229
Awesome.

102
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.769
All right, we're going to get
into a little bit of cardio so

103
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.447
we can get our heart rates up.

104
00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:04.059
So what we're going to do next,
everybody, is some jump rope.

105
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.729
Let's get those invisible jump
ropes out.

106
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.649
Get a bounce going.

107
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.089
Let's move it.

108
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.709
Good job, everybody.

109
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.635
All right.

110
00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:30.139
Nice, Avery.

111
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.179
Good job, Marcela.

112
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.791
All right, you all, we're
almost there.

113
00:06:45.846 --> 00:06:47.371
We got 15 seconds.

114
00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:49.839
Let's see if we can move it a
little faster.

115
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.135
Awesome.

116
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.789
We got 5,

117
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.899
4,

118
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.069
3,

119
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.239
2,

120
00:07:09.442 --> 00:07:10.695
and SPIRIT.

121
00:07:10.808 --> 00:07:13.069
All right, keep that bounce
going, everybody.

122
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.779
Up next we're going to run in
place.

123
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.827
So we're keeping our bounce
going, but we're going to pump

124
00:07:20.838 --> 00:07:23.855
our arms to go along with it.

125
00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:25.649
So we're just running in place.

126
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.809
If you have some space, you can
go side to side,

127
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.669
forward and back.

128
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.547
All right.

129
00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:47.879
Nice arm swing, Avery, keep
those arms pumping.

130
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.719
All right.

131
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.803
Nice, Marcela.

132
00:07:56.852 --> 00:07:58.155
Let's double time, everybody.

133
00:07:58.258 --> 00:08:00.059
Faster, faster, faster.

134
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.167
All right, so up next, we're
going to do a little bit of

135
00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:07.191
speedbag.

136
0:08:07.256 --> 0:08:09.869
So we're going to keep the
bounce going, but we're going

137
0:08:09.869 --> 0:08:14.260
to roll one hand over the other
as fast as we can, just like we

138
0:08:14.260 --> 0:08:16.080
would if we're hitting the
speedbag.

139
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.649
Let's do it.

140
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.269
You can go up, down, side to
side,

141
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.929
just keep those hands rolling.

142
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.274
Good job, everybody.

143
00:08:36.457 --> 00:08:37.779
10 seconds.

144
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.038
Look at those quick hands from
Avery.

145
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.928
Good job.

146
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.689
5,

147
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.139
4,

148
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.349
3,

149
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.609
2,

150
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.919
and SPIRIT.

151
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.275
Excellent, everybody.

152
00:08:55.378 --> 00:08:56.427
Good job, Marcela.

153
00:08:56.514 --> 00:08:57.831
Good job, Avery.

154
00:08:57.976 --> 00:09:00.849
All right, you all, we're going
to take ourselves a quick break.

155
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.169
While we're taking our break,
you all can get yourself set up

156
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.319
by having water, of course, so
you can stay hydrated.

157
00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:13.899
Keep a chair nearby just so you
can rest up in between our

158
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.495
breaks.

159
00:09:14.528 --> 00:09:17.845
And if you do have boxing
gloves, you can get those laced

160
00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:18.629
up now.

161
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.475
And we're going to start in
about 30 seconds, everybody.

162
00:09:23.578 --> 00:09:25.449
Good job with the warm up.

163
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.063
Hope you all are feeling fired
up and ready to go.

164
00:09:29.182 --> 00:09:30.889
We're going to have some fun
today.

165
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.769
That was a great warm up.

166
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.607
Nice.

167
00:09:35.694 --> 00:09:36.823
Yes, it was.

168
00:09:37.022 --> 00:09:38.519
The music helped.

169
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.909
Yeah, definitely.

170
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.989
All right, Marcela, Avery, are
we ready to go?

171
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.299
Ready to go.

172
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:48.939
Ready.

173
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.363
Let's do it.

174
00:09:50.562 --> 00:09:54.209
All right, you all, so here we
go.

175
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.411
First thing we're going to do,
everybody, we're going to start

176
00:09:58.422 --> 00:10:01.851
it off with a little general
exercise so we can get a little

177
00:10:01.862 --> 00:10:06.335
bit more warmed up, get our
body nice and fluid.

178
00:10:06.368 --> 00:10:08.607
So we're going to start off
with some floor touches.

179
00:10:08.624 --> 00:10:11.007
So we're going to reach those
hands up high, and then we're

180
00:10:11.018 --> 00:10:13.699
reaching them down towards the
floor.

181
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.071
And even if you can't touch the
floor, just reach those

182
00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:20.559
fingertips as close as you can
and try to get a little closer

183
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.491
each time.

184
00:10:21.546 --> 00:10:23.459
So we're going up and down.

185
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.469
Let's do it.

186
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.109
Good work, Marcela.

187
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.529
Good job, Avery.

188
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.939
Awesome, everybody out there,
keep it going.

189
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.339
We've got 10 seconds.

190
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.109
5,

191
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.379
4,

192
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.549
3,

193
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.729
2,

194
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.223
and SPIRIT.

195
00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:05.459
Awesome, everybody.

196
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.283
All right, we're going to
change gears now.

197
00:11:07.322 --> 00:11:09.067
We're going into boxing mode.

198
00:11:09.184 --> 00:11:11.143
So let's get those hands up.

199
00:11:11.182 --> 00:11:13.527
The back hand is going to be
covering the face.

200
00:11:13.694 --> 00:11:15.671
The front is going to cover the
body.

201
00:11:15.806 --> 00:11:17.603
If you're doing this one
standing, you're going to have

202
00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:18.895
a staggered stance.

203
00:11:18.948 --> 00:11:20.491
One foot in front of the other.

204
00:11:20.626 --> 00:11:23.735
And we're just going to get a
nice bounce going while we're

205
00:11:23.746 --> 00:11:26.059
in our boxing stance.

206
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.589
All right, so let's do it.

207
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.009
Move around a little bit,

208
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.479
find your rhythm.

209
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.879
All right, there's Avery.

210
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.335
He's feeling it.

211
00:11:40.358 --> 00:11:41.583
He's got those hands up.

212
00:11:41.622 --> 00:11:42.869
He's ready for anything.

213
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.589
Marcela, same thing.

214
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.483
She's ready to go.

215
00:11:50.522 --> 00:11:52.303
So let's do it, everybody,
first punch.

216
00:11:52.352 --> 00:11:55.311
We're going to start off with
our right jab.

217
00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:58.611
So we're just throwing a
straightforward punch and then

218
00:11:58.622 --> 00:12:02.649
back into our stance with the
hands up.

219
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.399
So quick right jab.

220
0:12:12.540 --> 0:12:16.009
And as you're throwing those
punches, make sure you lean

221
0:12:16.009 --> 0:12:19.500
into them to get more power,
get better balance.

222
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.399
Let's see it, Marcela.

223
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:23.775
Nice.

224
00:12:23.878 --> 00:12:24.769
Good job.

225
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.559
Way to step into those punches.

226
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.069
All right, let's switch it up
to the left jab, everybody.

227
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.887
Left jab.

228
00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:36.869
Let's go.

229
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.375
All right, there's Avery with
those blazing flash jabs.

230
00:12:43.568 --> 00:12:44.469
Good job.

231
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.107
Good work, everybody.

232
00:12:51.194 --> 00:12:52.339
Let's bring the two together.

233
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.709
Now we're going right and left
jab back to back.

234
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.189
Good job, everybody.

235
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.799
Right and left.

236
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:16.659
All right.

237
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.475
We change it up in the other
direction.

238
00:13:18.508 --> 00:13:20.495
We'll go left and right.

239
00:13:20.598 --> 00:13:22.819
We'll go back and forth between
the two.

240
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.069
Leading with the left, leading
with the right.

241
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.219
Awesome, Marcela.

242
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.729
All right, everybody, we got 5,

243
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.089
4,

244
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.379
3,

245
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.859
2,

246
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.859
and SPIRIT.

247
00:13:44.868 --> 00:13:46.089
Nice work.

248
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.523
All right, we've got one more
thing before we move along.

249
0:13:49.662 --> 0:13:53.303
We're going to take the floor
touch and the jabs and we're

250
0:13:53.303 --> 0:13:56.676
going to put the two together
just so we can work on some

251
0:13:56.676 --> 0:14:00.604
coordination, being able to
switch gears in an instant.

252
00:14:00.652 --> 00:14:05.195
So we're going to touch our
toes, pop up, one, two jab.

253
00:14:05.388 --> 00:14:08.879
Floor touch, quick, jab, jab.

254
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.389
Awesome, everybody.

255
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.299
Floor touch, pop up, jab, jab.

256
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.391
There you go, Avery.

257
00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:28.329
Nice work.

258
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.855
All right, let's take it a step
further, everybody.

259
00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.359
Floor touch, pop up, four jabs,

260
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.469
1, 2, 3, 4.

261
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.079
And a little bit more quickness
with those punches.

262
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.029
Let's go.

263
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.203
Good job, Marcela.

264
00:14:51.272 --> 00:14:51.889
10,

265
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.103
9,

266
00:14:53.302 --> 00:14:54.049
GREAT!

267
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.149
7,

268
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.199
6,

269
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.389
5,

270
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.479
4,

271
00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.599
3,

272
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.799
2,

273
00:15:01.062 --> 00:15:02.539
and SPIRIT.

274
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.969
Way to go, everybody.

275
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.535
Great job.

276
00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:07.659
Alright, we're gonna pass it
along to Avery.

277
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.839
He's going to lead us with the
next segment.

278
0:15:10.280 --> 0:15:12.191
All right, Kristian, what we're
going to start off doing this

279
0:15:12.191 --> 0:15:14.119
time around, we're going to
start off doing some shoulder

280
0:15:14.119 --> 0:15:14.784
presses.

281
0:15:14.832 --> 0:15:18.629
We're going to get about a good
30 seconds in of just pressing

282
0:15:18.629 --> 0:15:19.430
up,

283
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.589
like raising the roof.

284
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.569
Let's get about 30 seconds in
of this, okay?

285
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.363
Just like that.

286
00:15:30.402 --> 00:15:31.229
Great job.

287
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.269
There's Marcela.

288
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.539
Great job, Marcela.

289
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.049
Kristian raising the roof.

290
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.799
Already feeling the burn.

291
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.967
All right, we're about 15
seconds in.

292
00:15:48.134 --> 00:15:49.439
Let's finish it out strong.

293
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.009
Let's pick it up a little bit.

294
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.739
All right, 5,

295
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:04.909
4,

296
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.859
3,

297
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.159
2,

298
00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:08.679
and SPIRIT.

299
00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.631
All right, great job.

300
0:16:10.686 --> 0:16:12.843
With that, we're going to jump
right back into our boxing

301
0:16:12.843 --> 0:16:13.572
stance.

302
00:16:13.716 --> 00:16:17.027
This time around, we're going
to start off just throwing some

303
00:16:17.038 --> 00:16:18.429
right hook punches, okay?

304
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.789
And remember, when you're
throwing this hook punch, you

305
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.803
want to follow through all the
way across the front of your

306
00:16:33.814 --> 00:16:34.719
chest.

307
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.759
Great job, Kristian.

308
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.509
All right, we're going to
switch to our left,

309
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.049
just left hook punches only.

310
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.719
Great job, Marcela.

311
00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.943
All right, let's get a few more
in and then we're going to put

312
00:17:11.954 --> 00:17:13.068
them both together.

313
00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.019
All right, let's put them both
together.

314
00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.749
That's going to be a right and
a left.

315
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.749
Great job transitioning, guys.

316
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.509
Keep it up.

317
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.119
Great job, everyone.

318
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.049
Keep going.

319
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.051
Don't stop.

320
00:18:01.106 --> 00:18:01.947
Don't think about it.

321
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.559
Just keep throwing those
punches.

322
0:18:11.040 --> 0:18:13.317
All right, let's get ready to
put four of them together,

323
0:18:13.317 --> 0:18:14.110
everyone.

324
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:15.899
So it's going to be

325
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.269
1,

326
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.759
2,

327
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.209
3,

328
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.779
4.

329
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.339
Four quick hook punches.

330
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.339
Great job, Marcela.

331
00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.289
All right, let's go for 30
seconds, let's finish it out.

332
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.619
And remember, you want to reset
after you throw your punches.

333
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.831
Hands back up, four punches.

334
00:18:57.976 --> 00:19:00.379
Hands up, four punches.

335
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.415
All right, we got 10,

336
00:19:10.598 --> 00:19:11.423
9,

337
00:19:11.622 --> 00:19:12.369
GREAT!

338
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.409
7,

339
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.649
6,

340
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.699
5,

341
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:16.949
4,

342
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:17.959
3,

343
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.079
2,

344
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.139
and SPIRIT.

345
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.203
All right, great job, everyone.

346
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.163
Before I pass it along to
Marcela, we're going to jump

347
00:19:26.174 --> 00:19:29.043
right back into our shoulder
presses, and we're going to

348
00:19:29.054 --> 00:19:30.759
incorporate hook punches.

349
0:19:32.940 --> 0:19:36.919
Let's say five chest presses,
and then we're going to throw

350
0:19:36.919 --> 0:19:38.616
four hook punches.

351
00:19:38.648 --> 00:19:39.035
Okay?

352
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.079
So 1,

353
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.569
2,

354
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.139
3,

355
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.709
4,

356
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.309
5,

357
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.229
1,

358
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.619
2,

359
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.069
3,

360
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.599
4.

361
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:45.699
1,

362
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.129
2.

363
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.639
3,

364
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.139
4,

365
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:47.759
5,

366
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:48.749
1,

367
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:49.389
2,

368
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.779
3,

369
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.209
4.

370
00:19:50.466 --> 00:19:51.329
All right?

371
00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.791
Great job, everyone.

372
00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:00.769
Keep it up.

373
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.095
Nice combination, Avery.

374
00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:11.249
Feeling it.

375
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.169
All right, we got 10,

376
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.289
9,

377
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:20.855
GREAT!

378
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.719
7,

379
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.649
6,

380
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.969
5,

381
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:24.909
4,

382
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.209
3,

383
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.449
2,

384
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.499
and SPIRIT.

385
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.869
Awesome job, everyone.

386
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.687
Now I'll pass it along to
Marcela and see what she has up

387
00:20:35.698 --> 00:20:36.269
next.

388
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.403
All right.

389
00:20:37.442 --> 00:20:38.423
Thank you, Avery.

390
00:20:38.552 --> 00:20:42.599
Okay, our next target movement
is going to be our jumping jacks.

391
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.607
So I'm going to be doing the
standing version, which is I'm

392
00:20:45.618 --> 00:20:48.619
going to tap to the side, bring
my arms overhead

393
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.829
right in the middle.

394
0:20:52.980 --> 0:20:55.264
If you're doing the advanced
version, you can follow along

395
0:20:55.264 --> 0:20:56.580
with Kristian.

396
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.209
Nice.

397
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.869
Nice work.

398
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.269
Good job, Avery.

399
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.459
Keep it going for 20 seconds.

400
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.709
10,

401
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:34.955
9,

402
00:21:35.138 --> 00:21:35.963
GREAT!

403
00:21:36.162 --> 00:21:36.909
7,

404
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:37.819
6,

405
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.099
5,

406
00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.089
4,

407
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.019
3,

408
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.269
2,

409
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.809
and SPIRIT.

410
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:45.889
Awesome.

411
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:46.869
All right,

412
00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.231
we're going to do our uppercut,
so we're going to start with

413
00:21:51.242 --> 00:21:52.979
the right uppercut.

414
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.687
You're going to lean on the leg
that is in front of you and

415
00:21:56.698 --> 00:22:00.543
bring that uppercut all the way
through your hips.

416
00:22:00.672 --> 00:22:01.989
All the way through.

417
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.469
So let's do it.

418
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.349
Right uppercuts.

419
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.149
Just like that.

420
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.019
Very good.

421
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.809
Good, Avery.

422
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.999
Okay, let's do our left
uppercuts.

423
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.399
Left.

424
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.989
Good job, everyone.

425
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:56.789
Keep it going.

426
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.669
All right, let's do them
together.

427
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.409
Right, left, right, left
uppercuts.

428
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.519
All right, let's go.

429
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.169
Right and left, good job.

430
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.179
Good work, Avery.

431
00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.259
Excellent.

432
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.119
Keep it going for 20 more
seconds.

433
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.389
10,

434
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.409
9,

435
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:55.559
GREAT!

436
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:56.669
7,

437
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.939
6,

438
00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:58.959
5,

439
00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:00.359
4,

440
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.519
3,

441
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:02.849
2,

442
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.419
and SPIRIT.

443
00:24:05.622 --> 00:24:07.279
All right, keep moving, guys.

444
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.627
We are going to add the jumping
jack to our punches, so we're

445
00:24:11.638 --> 00:24:14.639
going to do two jumping jacks,
two uppercuts.

446
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.549
So let's try this.

447
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.389
That's 1,

448
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.249
2,

449
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.759
uppercut, uppercut.

450
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:22.749
1,

451
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.679
2,

452
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.269
uppercut, uppercut.

453
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.349
There you go.

454
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.869
Uppercut,

455
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.179
jumping jacks.

456
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.299
Nice.

457
00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.069
Good job, Kristian.

458
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.739
Awesome, Avery.

459
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.799
Nice work.

460
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.489
10,

461
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:18.939
9,

462
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.429
GREAT!

463
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.029
7,

464
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.269
6,

465
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.139
5,

466
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.069
4,

467
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.989
3,

468
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.839
2,

469
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.239
and SPIRIT.

470
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.719
Great job.

471
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.543
All right.

472
00:25:40.662 --> 00:25:42.491
Amazing stuff, Marcela.

473
00:25:42.556 --> 00:25:43.403
Good job, Avery.

474
00:25:43.452 --> 00:25:44.529
Good job, everybody.

475
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.319
Awesome work.

476
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.459
That was not easy combining
those exercises with the punches.

477
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.129
Let's go get some water.

478
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.389
Good job, everyone.

479
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.739
Oh, man, that was tough.

480
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.339
Coordination.

481
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.769
Was it easy?

482
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.529
Not at all.

483
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.243
But we did it, Marcela and
Avery, we made it through

484
00:26:12.254 --> 00:26:13.609
everybody, so

485
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:15.863
we win.

486
00:26:15.982 --> 00:26:18.839
But there's more to come,
everybody, so good job.

487
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.563
That was our first round.

488
00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:23.127
Before we officially take a
break, we're going to pick

489
00:26:23.138 --> 00:26:26.871
ourselves back up and get ready
for our challenge, where we're

490
00:26:26.882 --> 00:26:29.927
going to do 1 minute of an
exercise, and our goal is to

491
00:26:29.938 --> 00:26:33.163
get as many reps of that
exercise as we can.

492
00:26:33.202 --> 00:26:36.969
So what we're going to do is
we're going to do a little side

493
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.111
punching, so you can do this
three different ways.

494
00:26:40.166 --> 00:26:42.959
We got the seated version, we
got Marcela

495
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.899
with the baseline,

496
00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.763
and you can do it with me.

497
00:26:47.802 --> 00:26:50.629
So what I'll be doing is a side
step

498
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.419
with a punch.

499
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.855
Side step, punch, punch.

500
00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:58.903
So you're punching to the left
and the right.

501
00:26:59.022 --> 00:27:00.967
You can pick which punch you
want to do.

502
00:27:01.054 --> 00:27:04.889
You can do the jab, you can do
the hook, or the upper cut.

503
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.097
So you're just turning your
body to the side, throwing two

504
00:27:09.108 --> 00:27:11.963
punches, same thing on the
other side.

505
0:27:12.162 --> 0:27:15.176
All right, so each side that
you do, that's going to count

506
0:27:15.176 --> 0:27:16.270
as one.

507
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.603
So in 10 seconds, we're going
to get started and try to get

508
00:27:20.614 --> 00:27:22.479
in as many as we can.

509
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.583
So everybody get into your
stance, get that bounce going.

510
00:27:25.702 --> 00:27:26.769
Let's get ready.

511
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.739
And here we go.

512
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:33.663
Side punches

513
00:27:33.712 --> 00:27:34.275
in 3,

514
00:27:34.378 --> 00:27:34.883
2,

515
00:27:35.002 --> 00:27:35.427
1,

516
00:27:35.514 --> 00:27:36.549
let's do it.

517
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.869
Nice shot, Marcela.

518
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.099
Good work, Avery.

519
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.629
Awesome job, everybody, keep it
going.

520
00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.019
30 seconds, almost there.

521
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.029
20, keep it going, everybody.

522
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.299
Let's try to push a little bit
harder.

523
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.049
10,

524
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.169
9,

525
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.289
GREAT!

526
00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.409
7,

527
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:43.619
6,

528
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.899
5,

529
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.149
4,

530
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.139
3,

531
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.429
2,

532
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.299
and SPIRIT.

533
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.943
Awesome job, everybody.

534
00:28:52.142 --> 00:28:54.199
Good work, Marcela and Avery.

535
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.631
All right, on that note, let's
go take a break, so pull up

536
00:28:58.642 --> 00:28:59.747
those chairs.

537
00:28:59.864 --> 00:29:02.251
We're going to get about a
minute of resting before we

538
00:29:02.262 --> 00:29:05.809
pick it back up for round
number two.

539
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.311
Way to go, everybody.

540
00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:08.529
Awesome job.

541
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.249
All right, that was fun.

542
00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.751
Worked our way through all
three of our punches.

543
00:29:20.816 --> 00:29:24.149
Got a little cardio exercise in
there.

544
0:29:25.960 --> 0:29:29.553
So next step, we're going to
work on some defensive moves

545
0:29:29.553 --> 0:29:33.400
and bring those together to go
along with the punches.

546
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.687
Avery and Marcela, do you two
have a favorite punch of the

547
00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:44.429
three?

548
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.299
I like the jab punch.

549
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.449
Jab punch, okay.

550
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.329
Marcela, which one do you like?

551
00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.215
I like it all.

552
00:29:55.398 --> 00:29:56.063
All of them?

553
00:29:56.102 --> 00:29:58.719
Okay, you just like to throw
punches?

554
00:29:59.140 --> 00:29:59.889
Yes.

555
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.629
How about you?

556
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.299
I like the upper cut, I like
the power punch.

557
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:16.575
Jab is fun, hook is good, but
the upper cut, just bring all

558
00:30:16.586 --> 00:30:19.849
your energy together, and one
boom, that's it, done.

559
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.175
The jab punch is kind of like a
surprising punch, though, right?

560
00:30:23.198 --> 00:30:25.449
So you can snap it real quick,

561
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.909
catch them.

562
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.803
And you don't have to use too
much energy either.

563
00:30:31.922 --> 00:30:32.589
Yeah.

564
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.869
All right, everybody, if you've
got a favorite punch out there,

565
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.619
let us know in the chat.

566
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.775
All right, here we go.

567
00:30:45.798 --> 00:30:47.215
So let's get back into it.

568
00:30:47.238 --> 00:30:50.171
We're going to do round number
two now, and as I said, we're

569
00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:53.247
going to add in some defense to
go along with the moves that we

570
00:30:53.258 --> 00:30:54.275
already worked on.

571
00:30:54.378 --> 00:30:55.411
So let's get to it.

572
0:30:55.466 --> 0:30:57.829
First things first, we're going
to get into our boxing stance,

573
0:30:57.829 --> 0:31:00.470
get those hands up, get that
bounce going.

574
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.591
All right, our first defensive
move, we're going to start off

575
00:31:06.602 --> 00:31:07.843
with the shoulder roll.

576
0:31:07.892 --> 0:31:12.033
So for the shoulder roll, we're
just leaning side to side,

577
0:31:12.033 --> 0:31:14.184
rolling those shoulders left to
right.

578
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.075
Just imagine there's a punch
coming towards your face and

579
00:31:17.086 --> 00:31:20.471
you've got to avoid that punch,
so roll your shoulders as quick

580
00:31:20.482 --> 00:31:23.199
as you can so you don't get hit.

581
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.909
Let's go.

582
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.429
There's Avery doing a great job

583
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.799
with the quick side to side
movement, avoiding those punches.

584
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.155
Good work, everybody.

585
00:31:42.278 --> 00:31:43.987
So we practiced left to right.

586
00:31:44.074 --> 00:31:46.389
Let's do the same thing right
to left.

587
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.447
Awesome, Marcela.

588
00:31:48.544 --> 00:31:50.339
Way to add in the footwork.

589
0:31:55.880 --> 0:31:57.810
All right, everybody, we're
going to keep those shoulder

590
0:31:57.810 --> 00:32:02.227
rolls going, but we're going to
add two jabs and then shoulder

591
00:32:02.228 --> 0:32:02.656
rolls.

592
00:32:02.688 --> 00:32:05.727
So we're going left, right jab,
following it up with the

593
00:32:05.738 --> 00:32:07.139
shoulder rolls.

594
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.149
Good work, everybody.

595
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.889
Jab, jab, shoulder roll.

596
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.675
As Avery mentioned earlier,
after you finish your

597
00:32:21.686 --> 00:32:23.729
combination, make sure you reset.

598
00:32:23.814 --> 00:32:25.327
Get those hands back up.

599
00:32:25.414 --> 00:32:27.567
Cover your face and your body.

600
00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:28.959
Stay protected.

601
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.711
Awesome work, Avery.

602
00:32:31.766 --> 00:32:33.279
Good job, Marcela.

603
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.559
All right, we're going to take
it a step further, everybody.

604
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.015
We're going to add in another
punch.

605
00:32:38.048 --> 00:32:40.927
So we're still keeping our jab,
jab, shoulder roll, but we're

606
00:32:40.938 --> 00:32:43.171
going to add in two hooks at
the end.

607
00:32:43.226 --> 00:32:46.819
So jab, jab, shoulder roll,
shoulder roll, hook, hook.

608
00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:48.969
Let's go.

609
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

610
00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.223
Nice job with those.

611
00:32:55.262 --> 00:32:56.359
Quick punches.

612
00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.619
Quick shoulder rolls.

613
00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.675
Awesome, everybody.

614
00:33:03.778 --> 00:33:04.909
We got 10,

615
00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.029
9,

616
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.149
GREAT!

617
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.229
7,

618
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.459
6,

619
00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:10.499
5,

620
00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:11.729
4,

621
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:12.749
3,

622
00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:13.979
2,

623
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.079
and SPIRIT.

624
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.855
Way to go, everybody.

625
00:33:17.958 --> 00:33:18.849
Good job.

626
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.507
All right, Avery's

627
00:33:20.524 --> 00:33:22.849
going to show us our next move.

628
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.563
All right, Kristian, our next
defensive move that we're going

629
00:33:25.574 --> 00:33:27.663
to practice here today is going
to be the duck.

630
00:33:27.792 --> 00:33:28.115
All right?

631
00:33:28.138 --> 00:33:31.989
So if you're doing it seated
like myself, it's sort of like a

632
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.631
seated crunch.

633
00:33:33.696 --> 00:33:35.283
So I'm just going to duck like
this.

634
00:33:35.322 --> 00:33:36.655
My hands are still going to be
up.

635
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.269
My head is going to be up so I
can see.

636
00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.871
I'm going to duck like this.

637
00:33:40.926 --> 00:33:43.091
Okay, let's just practice.

638
00:33:43.236 --> 00:33:46.569
You can check out Marcela and
Kristian if you're standing to

639
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.755
follow along with them.

640
00:33:47.778 --> 00:33:48.349
Okay?

641
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.299
Great job, Marcela.

642
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.191
Remember, when you're ducking,
you still want to keep your

643
00:33:59.202 --> 00:34:00.369
guard up.

644
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.707
Sometimes when you duck, that's
when you get caught with that

645
00:34:05.718 --> 00:34:07.211
uppercut, Kristian.

646
00:34:07.356 --> 00:34:08.289
Oh, yeah.

647
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.009
Hands up, everybody.

648
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.709
Great job.

649
0:34:18.360 --> 0:34:21.036
All right, let's rock this out
for about another 20 seconds,

650
0:34:21.036 --> 0:34:23.219
and then we're going to add
some punches.

651
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.319
Great work, everyone.

652
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:32.329
Keep it up.

653
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.171
All right.

654
00:34:38.226 --> 00:34:38.923
10,

655
00:34:39.121 --> 00:34:39.869
9,

656
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.069
GREAT!

657
00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.169
7,

658
00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:43.218
6,

659
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:44.549
5,

660
00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:45.849
4,

661
00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:46.999
3,

662
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.249
2,

663
00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:49.959
and SPIRIT.

664
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.138
All right, we're still going to
keep our guards up.

665
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.959
We're still practicing our duck.

666
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.246
Now, this time around, we're
going to duck, and then we're

667
00:34:56.257 --> 00:34:59.143
going to throw a right hook and
a left hook.

668
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:02.999
Okay, so we're going to duck,
right, left.

669
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.649
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

670
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.759
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

671
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.429
Great job transitioning,
everyone.

672
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.179
Good work, Kristian.

673
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.369
Excellent.

674
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.139
Great job, Marcela.

675
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.399
All right, 20 seconds.

676
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.947
All right, let's finish it out
strong, everyone.

677
00:35:57.034 --> 00:35:57.669
10,

678
00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:58.949
9,

679
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.149
GREAT!

680
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.489
7,

681
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.649
6,

682
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.269
5,

683
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.829
4,

684
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.359
3,

685
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:08.889
2,

686
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.595
and SPIRIT.

687
00:36:10.708 --> 00:36:14.115
All right, we're going to keep
that same process going, but

688
00:36:14.126 --> 00:36:15.575
this time we're going to

689
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:20.649
duck, hook, hook, duck again,
right uppercut, left uppercut.

690
00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:22.859
Okay, so that's going to be a
duck,

691
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.879
hook, hook, another duck,

692
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.387
uppercut, upper cut.

693
00:36:27.474 --> 00:36:28.109
Okay?

694
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.799
Duck, hook, hook, duck again,
uppercut, uppercut.

695
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:34.239
Great.

696
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:35.329
Just like that.

697
00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.399
30 seconds.

698
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.589
Let's knock it out.

699
00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.299
Literally.

700
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.219
Great work, Kristian.

701
00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.119
Great job, Marcela.

702
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.319
All right, 15 seconds.

703
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.091
All right.

704
00:37:16.146 --> 00:37:16.843
10,

705
00:37:17.042 --> 00:37:17.789
9,

706
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:18.989
GREAT!

707
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.379
7,

708
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.319
6,

709
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.629
5,

710
00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:23.999
4,

711
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.309
3,

712
00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:26.969
2,

713
00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.959
and SPIRIT.

714
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.087
Great work, everyone.

715
00:37:31.174 --> 00:37:32.143
Great work.

716
00:37:32.342 --> 00:37:34.849
All right, Marcela, what do you
have for us next?

717
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.419
All right, our next defense
move is going to be the block.

718
00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.590
So for this one, try to bring
those elbows together right in

719
00:37:42.602 --> 00:37:44.629
front of our face to protect.

720
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.383
So we're going to start first
with our blocks.

721
00:37:48.512 --> 00:37:50.099
Side to side blocks.

722
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:53.619
Again.

723
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:54.869
Just like that.

724
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.709
Very good.

725
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.799
Good job, Kristian.

726
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.619
Nice, Avery.

727
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.903
We're going to keep going with
this block, and we're going to

728
00:38:29.914 --> 00:38:32.419
add some punches to the block.

729
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.939
Let's do that for another 10
seconds,

730
00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.339
9,

731
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.709
GREAT!

732
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.919
7,

733
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.259
6,

734
00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.429
5,

735
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:43.689
4,

736
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.909
3,

737
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.259
2,

738
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.359
and SPIRIT.

739
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.507
Good job, everyone, keep moving.

740
00:38:50.674 --> 00:38:52.555
Time for our uppercuts.

741
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.239
So we're going to do a block,
uppercut, uppercut.

742
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.549
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

743
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.239
Nice.

744
00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.709
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

745
00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.079
Excellent.

746
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:19.839
Block,

747
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.919
and uppercuts.

748
00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:23.719
Looking good, Avery.

749
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.629
Good job.

750
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:32.879
Nice, Kristian.

751
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.009
Good job, Marcela.

752
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.309
Get ready to add another punch.

753
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.759
So we're going to do

754
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.819
block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

755
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:51.469
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

756
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.739
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

757
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.899
There we go.

758
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.899
A lot to think in here.

759
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.049
Nice work.

760
00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.209
Good job, Kristian.

761
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.829
Nice, keep it up, keep it up,
almost there.

762
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.179
10,

763
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:26.789
9,

764
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.299
GREAT!

765
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.589
7,

766
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:30.789
6,

767
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:32.099
5,

768
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.819
4,

769
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:35.099
3,

770
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.379
SPIRIT.

771
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.199
Awesome.

772
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:43.919
All right.

773
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.011
Way to go, Marcela.

774
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.689
Way to go, Avery.

775
00:40:48.908 --> 00:40:51.151
That was a real workout,
everybody.

776
00:40:51.286 --> 00:40:52.483
Good job.

777
00:40:52.522 --> 00:40:54.869
Let's go get another quick sip
of water.

778
00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.587
All right, congratulations,
everybody.

779
00:41:03.674 --> 00:41:07.375
We made it to the finish line,
and we did it with style.

780
00:41:07.488 --> 00:41:09.735
You all did an amazing job
today.

781
00:41:09.918 --> 00:41:12.146
So what we're going to do next,
we're going to finish it off

782
00:41:12.158 --> 00:41:15.186
with some cool down stretches
so we can relax all those

783
00:41:15.198 --> 00:41:17.879
muscles that we fired up today.

784
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.983
Our first stretch, we're going
to start off with the side bend.

785
00:41:21.032 --> 00:41:22.103
We're going to get our core.

786
00:41:22.152 --> 00:41:24.279
We did a lot of twisting and
turning.

787
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.469
We're going to

788
0:41:26.080 --> 0:41:31.125
help those muscles relax by
bringing one arm up and over

789
0:41:31.125 --> 0:41:33.250
and leaning to the opposite side.

790
00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.399
We'll hold it for 10 seconds

791
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.619
and then switch.

792
00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.467
3,

793
00:41:44.634 --> 00:41:45.395
2,

794
00:41:45.578 --> 00:41:47.443
and switch it up.

795
00:41:47.562 --> 00:41:49.509
Same thing on the other side.

796
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.409
5,

797
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:02.409
4,

798
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.249
3,

799
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.079
2,

800
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.003
and SPIRIT.

801
00:42:05.072 --> 00:42:05.543
Good job.

802
00:42:05.582 --> 00:42:07.282
Now we're going to take both
hands and we're going to reach

803
00:42:07.294 --> 00:42:10.551
them down towards the floor,
and we're going to hold it.

804
00:42:10.606 --> 00:42:13.670
If you're standing up, try to
keep those legs nice and

805
00:42:13.682 --> 00:42:14.619
straight.

806
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.139
Reach down towards the floor.

807
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:28.829
5,

808
00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:29.739
4,

809
00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.659
3,

810
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:31.599
2,

811
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:32.523
and SPIRIT.

812
00:42:32.572 --> 00:42:33.119
Good job.

813
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.079
Last one, everybody.

814
0:42:34.150 --> 0:42:36.993
We're going to reach in the
opposite direction now, hands

815
0:42:36.993 --> 0:42:38.292
up above our head.

816
00:42:38.346 --> 00:42:41.155
Get those shoulders and arms
stretched out.

817
00:42:41.178 --> 00:42:43.316
If you want to get your lower
back in the mix, you could push

818
00:42:43.328 --> 00:42:45.369
your hips forward and lean back.

819
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.943
And we'll hold it for 10,

820
00:42:52.142 --> 00:42:52.983
9,

821
00:42:53.182 --> 00:42:53.975
GREAT!

822
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:54.929
7,

823
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.879
6,

824
00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.759
5,

825
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.769
4,

826
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:58.649
3,

827
00:42:58.770 --> 00:42:59.539
2,

828
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.519
and SPIRIT.

829
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.549
Awesome job today, everybody.

830
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.527
Great work, Avery.

831
00:43:05.544 --> 00:43:07.095
Good job, Marcela.

832
00:43:07.288 --> 00:43:09.415
Awesome work, Kristian and
Avery.

833
00:43:09.528 --> 00:43:12.055
And all of you, great job.

834
00:43:12.248 --> 00:43:13.403
Great job, everyone.

835
00:43:13.522 --> 00:43:14.615
Great work, Marcela.

836
00:43:14.648 --> 00:43:17.949
Great work, Kristian, awesome
class, love the energy.

837
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.711
Lots of fun as always,
everybody, thank you all again

838
00:43:23.722 --> 00:43:25.971
for being a part of this thing
with us.

839
00:43:26.106 --> 00:43:28.803
We appreciate you, and we look
forward to seeing you next time.

840
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.879
So everybody take care and we
will catch up with you soon.
