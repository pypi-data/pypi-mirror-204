Hello, everybody out there.

00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:06,819
Welcome you all to SPIRIT Club

00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,871
Virtual Boxing Fitness.

00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:10,863
My name is Kristian.

00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,755
Thank you all for being here

6
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:15,727
Along with me to give you all a 
great boxing workout, we have

7
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:18,197
two amazing trainers who are 
going to introduce themselves

8
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,669
to you all.

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,675
Hello, everyone.

10
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:23,447
My name is Marcella.

11
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:26,139
Very happy to be here with you.

12
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,109
I hope you guys enjoy the class.

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,523
Hello, everyone.

14
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:32,039
My name is Avery.

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,611
Thanks for joining us today.

16
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,735
Like Marcela said, I hope you 
guys are ready for a great class.

17
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:38,959
Let's jump right into it, 
Kristian.

18
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,795
All right, let's do it, Avery.

19
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,043
Let's do it, Marcela.

20
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:42,991
Let's go, everybody.

21
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:45,776
So we're going to kick our 
class off with some warm up

22
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:49,509
exercises so we can get the 
blood flowing, get our

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,339
body parts

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,703
ready for some action.

25
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:57,007
All right, so first thing we're 
going to start with everybody,

26
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:58,735
we're just going to do some 
side bends.

27
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:01,603
So let's spread those arms out 
to the side, and then we're

28
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:04,050
going to lean left to right, 
trying to reach those

29
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:07,529
fingertips as close to the 
floor as we can.

30
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,769
Here we go.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,698
Good job, everybody.

32
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,859
Looking good, Avery and Marcela.

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,091
Make sure you all are reaching 
those fingertips a little bit

34
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,649
lower each time.

35
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,871
Good work, Avery.

36
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:37,279
Good job, Marcela.

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,515
10 seconds, everybody.

38
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:39,589
Keep it going.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,239

2,

43
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:49,759
and SPIRIT.

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,419
Good job.

45
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,683
Next up, we're going to bring 
our elbows up to our sides and

46
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:55,719
we're going to twist left to 
right.

47
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,763
This is our torso twist.

48
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:01,421
We're going to open up our hips 
and our midsections by twisting

49
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:02,509
side to side.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,629
Here we go.

51
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,649
Good job, everybody.

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,299
Nice work, Avery.

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,231
Excellent, Marcela.

54
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:27,629
Keep it going, everybody.

55
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,331
All right, we're going to add 
on to our twist with some

56
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:35,779
punches so twist and punch.

57
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,649
Twist and punch.

58
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:40,209
Everybody, let's go.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,819
Good job.

60
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,651
We got 15 seconds.

61
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:53,939
Let's go faster.

62
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,969
Pick it up.

63
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,099
5----------

64

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,559
2,

67
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,135
and SPIRIT.

68
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:11,339
Awesome, everybody.

69
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,451
All right, we're going to move 
on to our arms next.

70
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,846
So we're going to wrap our arms 
up around our upper bodies,

71
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,552
give ourselves a nice big 
squeeze, and then we're going

72
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,204
to pull them apart, big and wide.

73
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,319
This is our SPIRIT fly.

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,149
Get our chest and shoulders 
nice and ready.

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,515
All right.

76
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:43,689
Nice stretch, Avery, way to 
open those arms up.

77
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,559
Awesome work, Marcela.

78
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,583
All right, everybody, 10 
seconds.

79
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:59,819
Let's try to pull those arms 
back further.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,749
5----------

81
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,989

82
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,199
3,

83
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,309
2,

84
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,011
and SPIRIT.

85
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:11,103
Nice, everybody.

86
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:13,131
Up next, we're going to do some 
swings.

87
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:16,667
We're going to do some leg 
swings and some arm swings.

88
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:19,279
So here's the leg swings.

89
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,575
If you want to do the arm 
swings, you can follow along

90
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:23,939
with Avery.

91
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,869
There it is right there.

92
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,029
Getting those legs and arms up.

93
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,849
Getting a nice reach, everybody, 
so let's get to it.

94
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,989
Good work, Marcela.

95
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,139
Good job, everyone.

96
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,389
Keep it going.

97
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,449
5----------

98
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,819
4,

99
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,119
3,

100
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,299
2,

101
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,971
and SPIRIT.

102
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,229
Awesome.

103
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,769
All right, we're going to get 
into a little bit of cardio so

104
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,447
we can get our heart rates up.

105
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:14,059
So what we're going to do next, 
everybody, is some jump rope.

106
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,729
Let's get those invisible jump 
ropes out.

107
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,649
Get a bounce going.

108
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,089
Let's move it.

109
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,709
Good job, everybody.

110
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,635
All right.

111
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:40,139
Nice, Avery.

112
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,179
Good job, Marcela.

113
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,791
All right, you all, we're 
almost there.

114
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:57,371
We got 15 seconds.

115
00:06:57,436 --> 00:06:59,839
Let's see if we can move it a 
little faster.

116
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,135
Awesome.

117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,789
We got 5,

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,899
4,

119
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,069
3,

120
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,239
2,

121
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:20,695
and SPIRIT.

122
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,069
All right, keep that bounce 
going, everybody.

123
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,779
Up next we're going to run in 
place.

124
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,827
So we're keeping our bounce 
going, but we're going to pump

125
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,855
our arms to go along with it.

126
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:35,649
So we're just running in place.

127
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,809
If you have some space, you can 
go side to side,

128
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,669
forward and back.

129
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,547
All right.

130
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:57,879
Nice arm swing, Avery, keep 
those arms pumping.

131
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,719
All right.

132
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,803
Nice, Marcela.

133
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,155
Let's double time, everybody.

134
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,059
Faster, faster, faster.

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,167
All right, so up next, we're 
going to do a little bit of

136
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:17,191
speedbag.

137
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:19,869
So we're going to keep the 
bounce going, but we're going

138
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:24,260
to roll one hand over the other 
as fast as we can, just like we

139
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,080
would if we're hitting the 
speedbag.

140
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,649
Let's do it.

141
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,269
You can go up, down, side to 
side,

142
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,929
just keep those hands rolling.

143
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,274
Good job, everybody.

144
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:47,779
10 seconds.

145
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,038
Look at those quick hands from 
Avery.

146
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,928
Good job.

147
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,689
5----------

148
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,139
4,

149
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,349
3,

150
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,609
2,

151
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,919
and SPIRIT.

152
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,275
Excellent, everybody.

153
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,427
Good job, Marcela.

154
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:07,831
Good job, Avery.

155
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:10,849
All right, you all, we're going 
to take ourselves a quick break.

156
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,169
While we're taking our break, 
you all can get yourself set up

157
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,319
by having water, of course, so 
you can stay hydrated.

158
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:23,899
Keep a chair nearby just so you 
can rest up in between our

159
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,495
breaks.

160
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:27,845
And if you do have boxing 
gloves, you can get those laced

161
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:28,629
up now.

162
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,475
And we're going to start in 
about 30 seconds, everybody.

163
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:35,449
Good job with the warm up.

164
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,063
Hope you all are feeling fired 
up and ready to go.

165
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,889
We're going to have some fun 
today.

166
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,769
That was a great warm up.

167
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,607
Nice.

168
00:09:45,694 --> 00:09:46,823
Yes, it was.

169
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:48,519
The music helped.

170
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,909
Yeah, definitely.

171
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,989
All right, Marcela, Avery, are 
we ready to go?

172
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,299
Ready to go.

173
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:58,939
Ready.

174
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,363
Let's do it.

175
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:04,209
All right, you all, so here we 
go.

176
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,411
First thing we're going to do, 
everybody, we're going to start

177
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:11,851
it off with a little general 
exercise so we can get a little

178
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:16,335
bit more warmed up, get our 
body nice and fluid.

179
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:18,607
So we're going to start off 
with some floor touches.

180
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:21,007
So we're going to reach those 
hands up high, and then we're

181
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:23,699
reaching them down towards the 
floor.

182
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,071
And even if you can't touch the 
floor, just reach those

183
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:30,559
fingertips as close as you can 
and try to get a little closer

184
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,491
each time.

185
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,459
So we're going up and down.

186
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,469
Let's do it.

187
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,109
Good work, Marcela.

188
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,529
Good job, Avery.

189
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,939
Awesome, everybody out there, 
keep it going.

190
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,339
We've got 10 seconds.

191
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,109
5----------

192
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,379
4,

193
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,549
3,

194
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,729
2,

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,223
and SPIRIT.

196
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:15,459
Awesome, everybody.

197
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,283
All right, we're going to 
change gears now.

198
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:19,067
We're going into boxing mode.

199
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:21,143
So let's get those hands up.

200
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,527
The back hand is going to be 
covering the face.

201
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:25,671
The front is going to cover the 
body.

202
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,603
If you're doing this one 
standing, you're going to have

203
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:28,895
a staggered stance.

204
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:30,491
One foot in front of the other.

205
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,735
And we're just going to get a 
nice bounce going while we're

206
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:36,059
in our boxing stance.

207
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,589
All right, so let's do it.

208
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,009
Move around a little bit,

209
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,479
find your rhythm.

210
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,879
All right, there's Avery.

211
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,335
He's feeling it.

212
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:51,583
He's got those hands up.

213
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:52,869
He's ready for anything.

214
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,589
Marcela, same thing.

215
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,483
She's ready to go.

216
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:02,303
So let's do it, everybody, 
first punch.

217
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:05,311
We're going to start off with 
our right jab.

218
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:08,611
So we're just throwing a 
straightforward punch and then

219
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:12,649
back into our stance with the 
hands up.

220
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,399
So quick right jab.

221
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,009
And as you're throwing those 
punches, make sure you lean

222
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:29,500
into them to get more power, 
get better balance.

223
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,399
Let's see it, Marcela.

224
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,775
Nice.

225
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,769
Good job.

226
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,559
Way to step into those punches.

227
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,069
All right, let's switch it up 
to the left jab, everybody.

228
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,887
Left jab.

229
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:46,869
Let's go.

230
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,375
All right, there's Avery with 
those blazing flash jabs.

231
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:54,469
Good job.

232
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,107
Good work, everybody.

233
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:02,339
Let's bring the two together.

234
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,709
Now we're going right and left 
jab back to back.

235
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,189
Good job, everybody.

236
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,799
Right and left.

237
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,659
All right.

238
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,475
We change it up in the other 
direction.

239
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,495
We'll go left and right.

240
00:13:30,598 --> 00:13:32,819
We'll go back and forth between 
the two.

241
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,069
Leading with the left, leading 
with the right.

242
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,219
Awesome, Marcela.

243
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,729
All right, everybody, we got 5,

244
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,089
4,

245
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,379
3,

246
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,859
2,

247
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,859
and SPIRIT.

248
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,089
Nice work.

249
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,523
All right, we've got one more 
thing before we move along.

250
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:03,303
We're going to take the floor 
touch and the jabs and we're

251
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:06,676
going to put the two together 
just so we can work on some

252
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:10,604
coordination, being able to 
switch gears in an instant.

253
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:15,195
So we're going to touch our 
toes, pop up, one, two jab.

254
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:18,879
Floor touch, quick, jab, jab.

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,389
Awesome, everybody.

256
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,299
Floor touch, pop up, jab, jab.

257
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,391
There you go, Avery.

258
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:38,329
Nice work.

259
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,855
All right, let's take it a step 
further, everybody.

260
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,359
Floor touch, pop up, four jabs,

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,469
1, 2, 3, 4.

262
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,079
And a little bit more quickness 
with those punches.

263
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,029
Let's go.

264
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,203
Good job, Marcela.

265
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:01,889
10,

266
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,103
9,

267
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,049
GREAT!

268
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,149
7,

269
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,199
6,

270
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,389
5----------

271
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,479
4,

272
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,599
3,

273
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,799
2,

274
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:12,539
and SPIRIT.

275
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,969
Way to go, everybody.

276
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,535
Great job.

277
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,659
Alright, we're gonna pass it 
along to Avery.

278
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,839
He's going to lead us with the 
next segment.

279
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,191
All right, Kristian, what we're 
going to start off doing this

280
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:24,119
time around, we're going to 
start off doing some shoulder

281
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:24,784
presses.

282
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:28,629
We're going to get about a good 
30 seconds in of just pressing

283
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:29,430
up,

284
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,589
like raising the roof.

285
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,569
Let's get about 30 seconds in 
of this, okay?

286
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,363
Just like that.

287
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:41,229
Great job.

288
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,269
There's Marcela.

289
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,539
Great job, Marcela.

290
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,049
Kristian raising the roof.

291
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,799
Already feeling the burn.

292
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,967
All right, we're about 15 
seconds in.

293
00:15:58,134 --> 00:15:59,439
Let's finish it out strong.

294
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,009
Let's pick it up a little bit.

295
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,739
All right, 5,

296
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,909
4,

297
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,859
3,

298
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,159
2,

299
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:18,679
and SPIRIT.

300
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,631
All right, great job.

301
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:22,843
With that, we're going to jump 
right back into our boxing

302
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:23,572
stance.

303
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,027
This time around, we're going 
to start off just throwing some

304
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:28,429
right hook punches, okay?

305
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,789
And remember, when you're 
throwing this hook punch, you

306
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,803
want to follow through all the 
way across the front of your

307
00:16:43,814 --> 00:16:44,719
chest.

308
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,759
Great job, Kristian.

309
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,509
All right, we're going to 
switch to our left,

310
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,049
just left hook punches only.

311
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,719
Great job, Marcela.

312
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,943
All right, let's get a few more 
in and then we're going to put

313
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:23,068
them both together.

314
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,019
All right, let's put them both 
together.

315
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,749
That's going to be a right and 
a left.

316
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,749
Great job transitioning, guys.

317
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,509
Keep it up.

318
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,119
Great job, everyone.

319
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,049
Keep going.

320
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,051
Don't stop.

321
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:11,947
Don't think about it.

322
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,559
Just keep throwing those 
punches.

323
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,317
All right, let's get ready to 
put four of them together,

324
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:24,110
everyone.

325
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,899
So it's going to be

326
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,269
1,

327
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,759
2,

328
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,209
3,

329
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:27,779
4.

330
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,339
Four quick hook punches.

331
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,339
Great job, Marcela.

332
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,289
All right, let's go for 30 
seconds, let's finish it out.

333
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,619
And remember, you want to reset 
after you throw your punches.

334
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,831
Hands back up, four punches.

335
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:10,379
Hands up, four punches.

336
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,415
All right, we got 10,

337
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:21,423
9,

338
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:22,369
GREAT!

339
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,409

340
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,649

and SPIRIT.

346
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,203
All right, great job, everyone.

347
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,163
Before I pass it along to 
Marcella, we're going to jump

348
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,043
right back into our shoulder 
presses, and we're going to

349
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,759
incorporate hook punches.

350
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,919
Let's say five chest presses, 
and then we're going to throw

351
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,616
four hook punches.

352
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:49,035
Okay?

353
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,079
So 1,

354
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,569

371
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:01,329
All right?

372
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,791
Great job, everyone.

373
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:10,769
Keep it up.

374
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,095
Nice combination, Avery.

375
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,249
Feeling it.

376
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,169
All right, we got 10,

377
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,289

378
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,855

and SPIRIT.

386
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,869
Awesome job, everyone.

387
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,687
Now I'll pass it along to 
Marcella and see what she has up

388
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:46,269
next.

389
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,403
All right.

390
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,423
Thank you, Avery.

391
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:52,599
Okay, our next target movement 
is going to be our jumping jacks.

392
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,607
So I'm going to be doing the 
standing version, which is I'm

393
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:58,619
going to tap to the side, bring 
my arms overhead

394
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,829
right in the middle.

395
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,264
If you're doing the advanced 
version, you can follow along

396
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,580
with Kristian.

397
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,209
Nice.

398
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,869
Nice work.

399
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,269
Good job, Avery.

400
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,459
Keep it going for 20 seconds.

401
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,709
10,

402
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,955
9,

403
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:45,963
GREAT!

404
00:21:46,162 --> 00:21:46,909

405
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,819

and SPIRIT.

411
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,889
Awesome.

412
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,869
All right,

413
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,231
we're going to do our uppercut, 
so we're going to start with

414
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:02,979
the right uppercut.

415
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,687
You're going to lean on the leg 
that is in front of you and

416
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:10,543
bring that uppercut all the way 
through your hips.

417
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:11,989
All the way through.

418
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,469
So let's do it.

419
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,349
Right uppercuts.

420
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,149
Just like that.

421
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,019
Very good.

422
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,809
Good, Avery.

423
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,999
Okay, let's do our left 
uppercuts.

424
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,399
Left.

425
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,989
Good job, everyone.

426
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,789
Keep it going.

427
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,669
All right, let's do them 
together.

428
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,409
Right, left, right, left 
uppercuts.

429
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,519
All right, let's go.

430
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,169
Right and left, good job.

431
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,179
Good work, Avery.

432
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,259
Excellent.

433
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,119
Keep it going for 20 more 
seconds.

434
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,389

and SPIRIT.

444
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,279
All right, keep moving, guys.

445
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,627
We are going to add the jumping 
jack to our punches, so we're

446
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:24,639
going to do two jumping jacks, 
two uppercuts.

447
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,549
So let's try this.

448
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,389
That's 1,

449
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,249
2,

450
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,759
uppercut, uppercut.

451
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,749
1,

452
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,679
2,

453
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,269
uppercut, uppercut.

454
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,349
There you go.

455
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,869
Uppercut,

456
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,179
jumping jacks.

457
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,299
Nice.

458
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,069
Good job, Kristian.

459
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,739
Awesome, Avery.

460
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,799
Nice work.

All right.

473
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:52,491
Amazing stuff, Marcela.

474
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:53,403
Good job, Avery.

475
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:54,529
Good job, everybody.

476
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,319
Awesome work.

477
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,459
That was not easy combining 
those exercises with the punches.

478
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,129
Let's go get some water.

479
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,389
Good job, everyone.

480
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,739
Oh, man, that was tough.

481
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,339
Coordination.

482
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,769
Was it easy?

483
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,529
Not at all.

484
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,243
But we did it, Marcela and 
Avery, we made it through

485
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:23,609
everybody, so

486
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,863
we win.

487
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:28,839
But there's more to come, 
everybody, so good job.

488
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,563
That was our first round.

489
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:33,127
Before we officially take a 
break, we're going to pick

490
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:36,871
ourselves back up and get ready 
for our challenge, where we're

491
00:26:36,882 --> 00:26:39,927
going to do 1 minute of an 
exercise, and our goal is to

492
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:43,163
get as many reps of that 
exercise as we can.

493
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,969
So what we're going to do is 
we're going to do a little side

494
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,111
punching, so you can do this 
three different ways.

495
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,959
We got the seated version, we 
got Marcela

496
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,899
with the baseline,

497
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,763
and you can do it with me.

498
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:00,629
So what I'll be doing is a side 
step

499
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,419
with a punch.

500
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,855
Side step, punch, punch.

501
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:08,903
So you're punching to the left 
and the right.

502
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:10,967
You can pick which punch you 
want to do.

503
00:27:11,054 --> 00:27:14,889
You can do the jab, you can do 
the hook, or the upper cut.

504
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,097
So you're just turning your 
body to the side, throwing two

505
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:21,963
punches, same thing on the 
other side.

506
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:25,176
All right, so each side that 
you do, that's going to count

507
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,270
as one.

508
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,603
So in 10 seconds, we're going 
to get started and try to get

509
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:32,479
in as many as we can.

510
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,583
So everybody get into your 
stance, get that bounce going.

511
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:36,769
Let's get ready.

512
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,739
And here we go.

513
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,663
Side punches

514
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:44,275
in 3,

515
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:44,883
2,

516
00:27:45,002 --> 00:27:45,427
1,

517
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:46,549
let's do it.

518
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,869
Nice shot, Marcela.

519
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,099
Good work, Avery.

520
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,629
Awesome job, everybody, keep it 
going.

521
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,019
30 seconds, almost there.

522
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,029
20, keep it going, everybody.

523
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,299
Let's try to push a little bit 
harder.

524
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,049
10,

525
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,169
9,

526
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,289
GREAT!

527
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,409
7,

528
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,619
6,

529
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,899
5----------

530
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,149
4,

531
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,139
3,

532
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,429
2,

533
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,299
and SPIRIT.

534
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,943
Awesome job, everybody.

535
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,199
Good work, Marcela and Avery.

536
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,631
All right, on that note, let's 
go take a break, so pull up

537
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:09,747
those chairs.

538
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:12,251
We're going to get about a 
minute of resting before we

539
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:15,809
pick it back up for round 
number two.

540
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,311
Way to go, everybody.

541
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:18,529
Awesome job.

542
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,249
All right, that was fun.

543
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,751
Worked our way through all 
three of our punches.

544
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:34,149
Got a little cardio exercise in 
there.

545
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,553
So next step, we're going to 
work on some defensive moves

546
00:29:39,553 --> 00:29:43,400
and bring those together to go 
along with the punches.

547
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,687
Avery and Marcela, do you two 
have a favorite punch of the

548
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:54,429
three?

549
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,299
I like the jab punch.

550
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,449
Jab punch, okay.

551
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,329
Marcela, which one do you like?

552
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,215
I like it all.

553
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:06,063
All of them?

554
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:08,719
Okay, you just like to throw 
punches?

555
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,889
Yes.

556
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,629
How about you?

557
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,299
I like the upper cut, I like 
the power punch.

558
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,575
Jab is fun, hook is good, but 
the upper cut, just bring all

559
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:29,849
your energy together, and one 
boom, that's it, done.

560
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,175
The jab punch is kind of like a 
surprising punch, though, right?

561
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,449
So you can snap it real quick,

562
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,909
catch them.

563
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,803
And you don't have to use too 
much energy either.

564
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:42,589
Yeah.

565
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,869
All right, everybody, if you've 
got a favorite punch out there,

566
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,619
let us know in the chat.

567
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,775
All right, here we go.

568
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:57,215
So let's get back into it.

569
00:30:57,238 --> 00:31:00,171
We're going to do round number 
two now, and as I said, we're

570
00:31:00,182 --> 00:31:03,247
going to add in some defense to 
go along with the moves that we

571
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:04,275
already worked on.

572
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:05,411
So let's get to it.

573
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,829
First things first, we're going 
to get into our boxing stance,

574
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:10,470
get those hands up, get that 
bounce going.

575
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,591
All right, our first defensive 
move, we're going to start off

576
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:17,843
with the shoulder roll.

577
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:22,033
So for the shoulder roll, we're 
just leaning side to side,

578
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:24,184
rolling those shoulders left to 
right.

579
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,075
Just imagine there's a punch 
coming towards your face and

580
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,471
you've got to avoid that punch, 
so roll your shoulders as quick

581
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:33,199
as you can so you don't get hit.

582
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,909
Let's go.

583
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,429
There's Avery doing a great job

584
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,799
with the quick side to side 
movement, avoiding those punches.

585
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,155
Good work, everybody.

586
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:53,987
So we practiced left to right.

587
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:56,389
Let's do the same thing right 
to left.

588
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,447
Awesome, Marcela.

589
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,339
Way to add in the footwork.

590
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,810
All right, everybody, we're 
going to keep those shoulder

591
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:12,227
rolls going, but we're going to 
add two jabs and then shoulder

592
00:32:12,228 --> 00:32:12,656
rolls.

593
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:15,727
So we're going left, right jab, 
following it up with the

594
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:17,139
shoulder rolls.

595
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,149
Good work, everybody.

596
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,889
Jab, jab, shoulder roll.

597
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,675
As Avery mentioned earlier, 
after you finish your

598
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:33,729
combination, make sure you reset.

599
00:32:33,814 --> 00:32:35,327
Get those hands back up.

600
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,567
Cover your face and your body.

601
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:38,959
Stay protected.

602
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,711
Awesome work, Avery.

603
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:43,279
Good job, Marcela.

604
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,559
All right, we're going to take 
it a step further, everybody.

605
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,015
We're going to add in another 
punch.

606
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:50,927
So we're still keeping our jab, 
jab, shoulder roll, but we're

607
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:53,171
going to add in two hooks at 
the end.

608
00:32:53,226 --> 00:32:56,819
So jab, jab, shoulder roll, 
shoulder roll, hook, hook.

609
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,969
Let's go.

610
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,559
Awesome work, Marcela.

611
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,223
Nice job with those.

612
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:06,359
Quick punches.

613
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,619
Quick shoulder rolls.

614
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,675
Awesome, everybody.

615
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:14,909
We got 10,

616
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,029
9,

617
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,149
GREAT!

618
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,229
7,

619
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,459
6,

620
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,499

621
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,729

622
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,749
3,

623
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:23,979
2,

624
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,079
and SPIRIT.

625
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,855
Way to go, everybody.

626
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:28,849
Good job.

627
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,507
All right, Avery's

628
00:33:30,524 --> 00:33:32,849
going to show us our next move.

629
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,563
All right, Kristian, our next 
defensive move that we're going

630
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:37,663
to practice here today is going 
to be the duck.

631
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,115
All right?

632
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:41,989
So if you're doing it seated 
like myself, it's sort of like a

633
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,631
seated crunch.

634
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:45,283
So I'm just going to duck like 
this.

635
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:46,655
My hands are still going to be 
up.

636
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,269
My head is going to be up so I 
can see.

637
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,871
I'm going to duck like this.

638
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:53,091
Okay, let's just practice.

639
00:33:53,236 --> 00:33:56,569
You can check out Marcela and 
Kristian if you're standing to

640
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,755
follow along with them.

641
00:33:57,778 --> 00:33:58,349
Okay?

642
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,299
Great job, Marcela.

643
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,191
Remember, when you're ducking, 
you still want to keep your

644
00:34:09,202 --> 00:34:10,369
guard up.

645
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,707
Sometimes when you duck, that's 
when you get caught with that

646
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:17,211
uppercut, Kristian.

647
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,289
Oh, yeah.

648
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,009
Hands up, everybody.

649
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,709
Great job.

650
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,036
All right, let's rock this out 
for about another 20 seconds,

651
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,219
and then we're going to add 
some punches.

652
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,319
Great work, everyone.

653
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,329
Keep it up.

654
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,171
All right.

655
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:48,923
10,

656
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:49,869
9,

657
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,069
GREAT!

658
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,169
7,

659
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,218
6,

660
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,549

00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:55,849

00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,999

00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,959
and SPIRIT.

665
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,138
All right, we're still going to 
keep our guards up.

666
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,959
We're still practicing our duck.

667
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,246
Now, this time around, we're 
going to duck, and then we're

668
00:35:06,257 --> 00:35:09,143
going to throw a right hook and 
a left hook.

669
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,999
Okay, so we're going to duck, 
right, left.

670
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,649
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

671
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,759
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

672
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,429
Great job transitioning, 
everyone.

673
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,179
Good work, Kristian.

674
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,369
Excellent.

675
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,139
Great job, Marcela.

676
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,399
All right, 20 seconds.

677
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,947
All right, let's finish it out 
strong, everyone.

678
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:07,669
10,

679
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,949
9,

680
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,149
GREAT!

681
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,489

682
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,649

00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,595
and SPIRIT.

688
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:24,115
All right, we're going to keep 
that same process going, but

689
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:25,575
this time we're going to

690
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,649
duck, hook, hook, duck again, 
right uppercut, left uppercut.

691
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:32,859
Okay, so that's going to be a 
duck,

692
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,879
hook, hook, another duck,

693
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,387
uppercut, upper cut.

694
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:38,109
Okay?

695
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,799
Duck, hook, hook, duck again, 
uppercut, uppercut.

696
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,239
Great.

697
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,329
Just like that.

698
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,399
30 seconds.

699
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,589
Let's knock it out.

700
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,299
Literally.

701
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,219
Great work, Kristian.

702
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,119
Great job, Marcela.

703
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,319
All right, 15 seconds.

704
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,091
All right.

705
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:26,843
10,

706
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:27,789
9,

707
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:28,989
GREAT!

708
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,379

709
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,319

715
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,087
Great work, everyone.

716
00:37:41,174 --> 00:37:42,143
Great work.

717
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:44,849
All right, Marcela, what do you 
have for us next?

718
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,419
All right, our next defense 
move is going to be the block.

719
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,590
So for this one, try to bring 
those elbows together right in

720
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:54,629
front of our face to protect.

721
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,383
So we're going to start first 
with our blocks.

722
00:37:58,512 --> 00:38:00,099
Side to side blocks.

723
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,619
Again.

724
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,869
Just like that.

725
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,709
Very good.

726
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,799
Good job, Kristian.

727
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,619
Nice, Avery.

728
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,903
We're going to keep going with 
this block, and we're going to

729
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:42,419
add some punches to the block.

730
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,939
Let's do that for another 10 
seconds,

731
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,339
9,

732
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,709
GREAT!

733
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,919

734
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,259

and SPIRIT.

740
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,507
Good job, everyone, keep moving.

741
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,555
Time for our uppercuts.

742
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,239
So we're going to do a block, 
uppercut, uppercut.

743
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,549
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

744
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,239
Nice.

745
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,709
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

746
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,079
Excellent.

747
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,839
Block,

748
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,919
and uppercuts.

749
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,719
Looking good, Avery.

750
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,629
Good job.

751
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,879
Nice, Kristian.

752
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,009
Good job, Marcela.

753
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,309
Get ready to add another punch.

754
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,759
So we're going to do

755
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,819
block, uppercut, uppercut, 
block, jab, jab.

756
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,469
Block, uppercut, uppercut, 
block, jab, jab.

757
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,739
Block, uppercut, uppercut, 
block, jab, jab.

758
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,899
There we go.

759
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,899
A lot to think in here.

760
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,049
Nice work.

761
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,209
Good job, Kristian.

762
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,829
Nice, keep it up, keep it up, 
almost there.

Awesome.

773
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,919
All right.

774
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,011
Way to go, Marcela.

775
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,689
Way to go, Avery.

776
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:01,151
That was a real workout, 
everybody.

777
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:02,483
Good job.

778
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:04,869
Let's go get another quick sip 
of water.

779
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,587
All right, congratulations, 
everybody.

780
00:41:13,674 --> 00:41:17,375
We made it to the finish line, 
and we did it with style.

781
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:19,735
You all did an amazing job 
today.

782
00:41:19,918 --> 00:41:22,146
So what we're going to do next, 
we're going to finish it off

783
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:25,186
with some cool down stretches 
so we can relax all those

784
00:41:25,198 --> 00:41:27,879
muscles that we fired up today.

785
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,983
Our first stretch, we're going 
to start off with the side bend.

786
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:32,103
We're going to get our core.

787
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:34,279
We did a lot of twisting and 
turning.

788
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,469
We're going to

789
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,125
help those muscles relax by 
bringing one arm up and over

790
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,250
and leaning to the opposite side.

791
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,399
We'll hold it for 10 seconds

792
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,619
and then switch.

793
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,467
3,

794
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:55,395
2,

795
00:41:55,578 --> 00:41:57,443
and switch it up.

796
00:41:57,562 --> 00:41:59,509
Same thing on the other side.

797
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,409

00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:15,543
Good job.

803
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:17,282
Now we're going to take both 
hands and we're going to reach

804
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:20,551
them down towards the floor, 
and we're going to hold it.

805
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:23,670
If you're standing up, try to 
keep those legs nice and

806
00:42:23,682 --> 00:42:24,619
straight.

807
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,139
Reach down towards the floor.

808
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,829

Good job.

814
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,079
Last one, everybody.

815
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,993
We're going to reach in the 
opposite direction now, hands

816
00:42:46,993 --> 00:42:48,292
up above our head.

817
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:51,155
Get those shoulders and arms 
stretched out.

818
00:42:51,178 --> 00:42:53,316
If you want to get your lower 
back in the mix, you could push

819
00:42:53,328 --> 00:42:55,369
your hips forward and lean back.

820
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,943
And we'll hold it for 10,

821
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:02,983

822
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:03,975

Lots of fun as always, 
everybody, thank you all again
