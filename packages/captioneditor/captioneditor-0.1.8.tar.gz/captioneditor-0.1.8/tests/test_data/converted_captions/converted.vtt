01:02.880 --> 01:04.291
Hello, everybody out there.

01:04.346 --> 01:06.819
Welcome you all to SPIRIT Club

01:07.480 --> 01:09.871
Virtual Boxing Fitness.

01:09.936 --> 01:10.863
My name is Kristian.

01:10.912 --> 01:12.755
Thank you all for being here
today.

01:12.938 --> 01:15.727
Along with me to give you all a
great boxing workout, we have

01:15.738 --> 01:18.197
two amazing trainers who are
going to introduce themselves

01:18.208 --> 01:19.669
to you all.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.675
Hello, everyone.

01:21.858 --> 01:23.447
My name is Marcella.

01:23.544 --> 01:26.139
Very happy to be here with you.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.109
I hope you guys enjoy the class.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.523
Hello, everyone.

01:30.642 --> 01:32.039
My name is Avery.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.611
Thanks for joining us today.

01:33.666 --> 01:36.735
Like Marcela said, I hope you
guys are ready for a great class.

01:36.918 --> 01:38.959
Let's jump right into it,
Kristian.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.795
All right, let's do it, Avery.

01:40.828 --> 01:42.043
Let's do it, Marcela.

01:42.092 --> 01:42.991
Let's go, everybody.

01:43.126 --> 01:45.776
So we're going to kick our
class off with some warm up

01:45.788 --> 01:49.509
exercises so we can get the
blood flowing, get our

01:51.000 --> 01:52.339
body parts

01:53.480 --> 01:54.703
ready for some action.

01:54.752 --> 01:57.007
All right, so first thing we're
going to start with everybody,

01:57.018 --> 01:58.735
we're just going to do some
side bends.

01:58.768 --> 02:01.603
So let's spread those arms out
to the side, and then we're

02:01.614 --> 02:04.050
going to lean left to right,
trying to reach those

02:04.062 --> 02:07.529
fingertips as close to the
floor as we can.

02:08.620 --> 02:09.769
Here we go.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.698
Good job, everybody.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.859
Looking good, Avery and Marcela.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.091
Make sure you all are reaching
those fingertips a little bit

02:24.102 --> 02:25.649
lower each time.

02:34.660 --> 02:35.871
Good work, Avery.

02:35.936 --> 02:37.279
Good job, Marcela.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.515
10 seconds, everybody.

02:38.618 --> 02:39.589
Keep it going.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.239
5----------

02:45.590 --> 02:46.409
4,

02:46.630 --> 02:47.379
3,

02:47.750 --> 02:48.569
2,

02:48.698 --> 02:49.759
and SPIRIT.

02:49.840 --> 02:50.419
Good job.

02:50.490 --> 02:53.683
Next up, we're going to bring
our elbows up to our sides and

02:53.694 --> 02:55.719
we're going to twist left to
right.

02:55.790 --> 02:57.763
This is our torso twist.

02:57.892 --> 03:01.421
We're going to open up our hips
and our midsections by twisting

03:01.432 --> 03:02.509
side to side.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.629
Here we go.

03:13.180 --> 03:14.649
Good job, everybody.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.299
Nice work, Avery.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.231
Excellent, Marcela.

03:26.296 --> 03:27.629
Keep it going, everybody.

03:28.980 --> 03:32.331
All right, we're going to add
on to our twist with some

03:32.342 --> 03:35.779
punches so twist and punch.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.649
Twist and punch.

03:38.716 --> 03:40.209
Everybody, let's go.

03:50.200 --> 03:50.819
Good job.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.651
We got 15 seconds.

03:52.736 --> 03:53.939
Let's go faster.

03:54.020 --> 03:54.969
Pick it up.

04:04.380 --> 04:05.099
5----------

04:05.510 --> 04:06.269
4,

04:06.630 --> 04:07.469
3,

04:07.800 --> 04:08.559
2,

04:08.880 --> 04:10.135
and SPIRIT.

04:10.248 --> 04:11.339
Awesome, everybody.

04:11.490 --> 04:15.451
All right, we're going to move
on to our arms next.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.846
So we're going to wrap our arms
up around our upper bodies,

04:18.846 --> 04:21.552
give ourselves a nice big
squeeze, and then we're going

04:21.552 --> 04:24.204
to pull them apart, big and wide.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.319
This is our SPIRIT fly.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.149
Get our chest and shoulders
nice and ready.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.515
All right.

04:40.618 --> 04:43.689
Nice stretch, Avery, way to
open those arms up.

04:49.420 --> 04:51.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.583
All right, everybody, 10
seconds.

04:56.632 --> 04:59.819
Let's try to pull those arms
back further.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.749
5----------

05:05.170 --> 05:05.989
4,

05:06.330 --> 05:07.199
3,

05:07.440 --> 05:08.309
2,

05:08.660 --> 05:10.011
and SPIRIT.

05:10.156 --> 05:11.103
Nice, everybody.

05:11.222 --> 05:13.131
Up next, we're going to do some
swings.

05:13.196 --> 05:16.667
We're going to do some leg
swings and some arm swings.

05:16.764 --> 05:19.279
So here's the leg swings.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.575
If you want to do the arm
swings, you can follow along

05:22.586 --> 05:23.939
with Avery.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.869
There it is right there.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.029
Getting those legs and arms up.

05:34.060 --> 05:37.849
Getting a nice reach, everybody,
so let's get to it.

05:38.540 --> 05:39.989
Good work, Marcela.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.139
Good job, everyone.

05:52.290 --> 05:53.389
Keep it going.

05:58.740 --> 05:59.449
5----------

06:00.050 --> 06:00.819
4,

06:01.290 --> 06:02.119
3,

06:02.560 --> 06:03.299
2,

06:03.620 --> 06:04.971
and SPIRIT.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.229
Awesome.

06:06.340 --> 06:08.769
All right, we're going to get
into a little bit of cardio so

06:08.780 --> 06:10.447
we can get our heart rates up.

06:10.534 --> 06:14.059
So what we're going to do next,
everybody, is some jump rope.

06:14.220 --> 06:17.729
Let's get those invisible jump
ropes out.

06:18.180 --> 06:19.649
Get a bounce going.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.089
Let's move it.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.709
Good job, everybody.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.635
All right.

06:38.738 --> 06:40.139
Nice, Avery.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.179
Good job, Marcela.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.791
All right, you all, we're
almost there.

06:55.846 --> 06:57.371
We got 15 seconds.

06:57.436 --> 06:59.839
Let's see if we can move it a
little faster.

07:13.340 --> 07:14.135
Awesome.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.789
We got 5,

07:16.160 --> 07:16.899
4,

07:17.280 --> 07:18.069
3,

07:18.410 --> 07:19.239
2,

07:19.442 --> 07:20.695
and SPIRIT.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.069
All right, keep that bounce
going, everybody.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.779
Up next we're going to run in
place.

07:26.850 --> 07:30.827
So we're keeping our bounce
going, but we're going to pump

07:30.838 --> 07:33.855
our arms to go along with it.

07:33.878 --> 07:35.649
So we're just running in place.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.809
If you have some space, you can
go side to side,

07:42.440 --> 07:43.669
forward and back.

07:51.960 --> 07:52.547
All right.

07:52.634 --> 07:57.879
Nice arm swing, Avery, keep
those arms pumping.

08:05.100 --> 08:05.719
All right.

08:05.790 --> 08:06.803
Nice, Marcela.

08:06.852 --> 08:08.155
Let's double time, everybody.

08:08.258 --> 08:10.059
Faster, faster, faster.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.167
All right, so up next, we're
going to do a little bit of

08:16.178 --> 08:17.191
speedbag.

08:17.256 --> 08:19.869
So we're going to keep the
bounce going, but we're going

08:19.869 --> 08:24.260
to roll one hand over the other
as fast as we can, just like we

08:24.260 --> 08:26.080
would if we're hitting the
speedbag.

08:27.730 --> 08:28.649
Let's do it.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.269
You can go up, down, side to
side,

08:34.360 --> 08:35.929
just keep those hands rolling.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.274
Good job, everybody.

08:46.457 --> 08:47.779
10 seconds.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.038
Look at those quick hands from
Avery.

08:53.020 --> 08:53.928
Good job.

08:56.930 --> 08:57.689
5----------

08:58.270 --> 08:59.139
4,

08:59.470 --> 09:00.349
3,

09:00.740 --> 09:01.609
2,

09:01.920 --> 09:03.919
and SPIRIT.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.275
Excellent, everybody.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.427
Good job, Marcela.

09:06.514 --> 09:07.831
Good job, Avery.

09:07.976 --> 09:10.849
All right, you all, we're going
to take ourselves a quick break.

09:12.110 --> 09:16.169
While we're taking our break,
you all can get yourself set up

09:16.180 --> 09:20.319
by having water, of course, so
you can stay hydrated.

09:20.508 --> 09:23.899
Keep a chair nearby just so you
can rest up in between our

09:23.910 --> 09:24.495
breaks.

09:24.528 --> 09:27.845
And if you do have boxing
gloves, you can get those laced

09:27.856 --> 09:28.629
up now.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.475
And we're going to start in
about 30 seconds, everybody.

09:33.578 --> 09:35.449
Good job with the warm up.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.063
Hope you all are feeling fired
up and ready to go.

09:39.182 --> 09:40.889
We're going to have some fun
today.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.769
That was a great warm up.

09:45.100 --> 09:45.607
Nice.

09:45.694 --> 09:46.823
Yes, it was.

09:47.022 --> 09:48.519
The music helped.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.909
Yeah, definitely.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.989
All right, Marcela, Avery, are
we ready to go?

09:57.440 --> 09:58.299
Ready to go.

09:58.370 --> 09:58.939
Ready.

09:59.090 --> 10:00.363
Let's do it.

10:00.562 --> 10:04.209
All right, you all, so here we
go.

10:05.380 --> 10:08.411
First thing we're going to do,
everybody, we're going to start

10:08.422 --> 10:11.851
it off with a little general
exercise so we can get a little

10:11.862 --> 10:16.335
bit more warmed up, get our
body nice and fluid.

10:16.368 --> 10:18.607
So we're going to start off
with some floor touches.

10:18.624 --> 10:21.007
So we're going to reach those
hands up high, and then we're

10:21.018 --> 10:23.699
reaching them down towards the
floor.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.071
And even if you can't touch the
floor, just reach those

10:27.082 --> 10:30.559
fingertips as close as you can
and try to get a little closer

10:30.570 --> 10:31.491
each time.

10:31.546 --> 10:33.459
So we're going up and down.

10:33.530 --> 10:34.469
Let's do it.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.109
Good work, Marcela.

10:47.110 --> 10:48.529
Good job, Avery.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.939
Awesome, everybody out there,
keep it going.

11:01.590 --> 11:03.339
We've got 10 seconds.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.109
5----------

11:09.610 --> 11:10.379
4,

11:10.730 --> 11:11.549
3,

11:11.900 --> 11:12.729
2,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.223
and SPIRIT.

11:14.352 --> 11:15.459
Awesome, everybody.

11:15.610 --> 11:17.283
All right, we're going to
change gears now.

11:17.322 --> 11:19.067
We're going into boxing mode.

11:19.184 --> 11:21.143
So let's get those hands up.

11:21.182 --> 11:23.527
The back hand is going to be
covering the face.

11:23.694 --> 11:25.671
The front is going to cover the
body.

11:25.806 --> 11:27.603
If you're doing this one
standing, you're going to have

11:27.614 --> 11:28.895
a staggered stance.

11:28.948 --> 11:30.491
One foot in front of the other.

11:30.626 --> 11:33.735
And we're just going to get a
nice bounce going while we're

11:33.746 --> 11:36.059
in our boxing stance.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.589
All right, so let's do it.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.009
Move around a little bit,

11:43.060 --> 11:44.479
find your rhythm.

11:47.060 --> 11:48.879
All right, there's Avery.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.335
He's feeling it.

11:50.358 --> 11:51.583
He's got those hands up.

11:51.622 --> 11:52.869
He's ready for anything.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.589
Marcela, same thing.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.483
She's ready to go.

12:00.522 --> 12:02.303
So let's do it, everybody,
first punch.

12:02.352 --> 12:05.311
We're going to start off with
our right jab.

12:05.376 --> 12:08.611
So we're just throwing a
straightforward punch and then

12:08.622 --> 12:12.649
back into our stance with the
hands up.

12:14.780 --> 12:17.399
So quick right jab.

12:22.540 --> 12:26.009
And as you're throwing those
punches, make sure you lean

12:26.009 --> 12:29.500
into them to get more power,
get better balance.

12:30.660 --> 12:32.399
Let's see it, Marcela.

12:33.220 --> 12:33.775
Nice.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.769
Good job.

12:36.260 --> 12:38.559
Way to step into those punches.

12:40.900 --> 12:44.069
All right, let's switch it up
to the left jab, everybody.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.887
Left jab.

12:45.984 --> 12:46.869
Let's go.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.375
All right, there's Avery with
those blazing flash jabs.

12:53.568 --> 12:54.469
Good job.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.107
Good work, everybody.

13:01.194 --> 13:02.339
Let's bring the two together.

13:02.410 --> 13:06.709
Now we're going right and left
jab back to back.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.189
Good job, everybody.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.799
Right and left.

13:26.300 --> 13:26.659
All right.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.475
We change it up in the other
direction.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.495
We'll go left and right.

13:30.598 --> 13:32.819
We'll go back and forth between
the two.

13:32.970 --> 13:36.069
Leading with the left, leading
with the right.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.219
Awesome, Marcela.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.729
All right, everybody, we got 5,

13:49.320 --> 13:50.089
4,

13:50.570 --> 13:51.379
3,

13:51.980 --> 13:52.859
2,

13:53.180 --> 13:54.859
and SPIRIT.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.089
Nice work.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.523
All right, we've got one more
thing before we move along.

13:59.662 --> 14:03.303
We're going to take the floor
touch and the jabs and we're

14:03.303 --> 14:06.676
going to put the two together
just so we can work on some

14:06.676 --> 14:10.604
coordination, being able to
switch gears in an instant.

14:10.652 --> 14:15.195
So we're going to touch our
toes, pop up, one, two jab.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.879
Floor touch, quick, jab, jab.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.389
Awesome, everybody.

14:31.480 --> 14:35.299
Floor touch, pop up, jab, jab.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.391
There you go, Avery.

14:37.466 --> 14:38.329
Nice work.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.855
All right, let's take it a step
further, everybody.

14:42.958 --> 14:46.359
Floor touch, pop up, four jabs,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.469
1, 2, 3, 4.

14:53.520 --> 14:57.079
And a little bit more quickness
with those punches.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.029
Let's go.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.203
Good job, Marcela.

15:01.272 --> 15:01.889
10,

15:02.260 --> 15:03.103
9,

15:03.302 --> 15:04.049
GREAT!

15:04.500 --> 15:05.149
7,

15:05.380 --> 15:06.199
6,

15:06.580 --> 15:07.389
5----------

15:07.680 --> 15:08.479
4,

15:08.800 --> 15:09.599
3,

15:09.960 --> 15:10.799
2,

15:11.062 --> 15:12.539
and SPIRIT.

15:12.700 --> 15:13.969
Way to go, everybody.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.535
Great job.

15:15.638 --> 15:17.659
Alright, we're gonna pass it
along to Avery.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.839
He's going to lead us with the
next segment.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.191
All right, Kristian, what we're
going to start off doing this

15:22.191 --> 15:24.119
time around, we're going to
start off doing some shoulder

15:24.119 --> 15:24.784
presses.

15:24.832 --> 15:28.629
We're going to get about a good
30 seconds in of just pressing

15:28.629 --> 15:29.430
up,

15:30.040 --> 15:31.589
like raising the roof.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.569
Let's get about 30 seconds in
of this, okay?

15:39.440 --> 15:40.363
Just like that.

15:40.402 --> 15:41.229
Great job.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.269
There's Marcela.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.539
Great job, Marcela.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.049
Kristian raising the roof.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.799
Already feeling the burn.

15:55.460 --> 15:57.967
All right, we're about 15
seconds in.

15:58.134 --> 15:59.439
Let's finish it out strong.

15:59.510 --> 16:01.009
Let's pick it up a little bit.

16:12.760 --> 16:13.739
All right, 5,

16:14.090 --> 16:14.909
4,

16:15.070 --> 16:15.859
3,

16:16.310 --> 16:17.159
2,

16:17.306 --> 16:18.679
and SPIRIT.

16:19.420 --> 16:20.631
All right, great job.

16:20.686 --> 16:22.843
With that, we're going to jump
right back into our boxing

16:22.843 --> 16:23.572
stance.

16:23.716 --> 16:27.027
This time around, we're going
to start off just throwing some

16:27.038 --> 16:28.429
right hook punches, okay?

16:37.520 --> 16:39.789
And remember, when you're
throwing this hook punch, you

16:39.800 --> 16:43.803
want to follow through all the
way across the front of your

16:43.814 --> 16:44.719
chest.

16:56.260 --> 16:57.759
Great job, Kristian.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.509
All right, we're going to
switch to our left,

17:04.520 --> 17:07.049
just left hook punches only.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.719
Great job, Marcela.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.943
All right, let's get a few more
in and then we're going to put

17:21.954 --> 17:23.068
them both together.

17:29.359 --> 17:31.019
All right, let's put them both
together.

17:31.089 --> 17:32.749
That's going to be a right and
a left.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.749
Great job transitioning, guys.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.509
Keep it up.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.119
Great job, everyone.

17:58.190 --> 17:59.049
Keep going.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.051
Don't stop.

18:11.106 --> 18:11.947
Don't think about it.

18:11.950 --> 18:13.559
Just keep throwing those
punches.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.317
All right, let's get ready to
put four of them together,

18:23.317 --> 18:24.110
everyone.

18:25.080 --> 18:25.899
So it's going to be

18:25.900 --> 18:26.269
1,

18:26.270 --> 18:26.759
2,

18:26.760 --> 18:27.209
3,

18:27.210 --> 18:27.779
4.

18:29.550 --> 18:31.339
Four quick hook punches.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.339
Great job, Marcela.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.289
All right, let's go for 30
seconds, let's finish it out.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.619
And remember, you want to reset
after you throw your punches.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.831
Hands back up, four punches.

19:07.976 --> 19:10.379
Hands up, four punches.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.415
All right, we got 10,

19:20.598 --> 19:21.423
9,

19:21.622 --> 19:22.369
GREAT!

19:22.760 --> 19:23.409
7,

19:23.840 --> 19:24.649
6,

19:24.940 --> 19:25.699
5----------

19:26.040 --> 19:26.949
4,

19:27.120 --> 19:27.959
3,

19:28.280 --> 19:29.079
2,

19:29.570 --> 19:31.139
and SPIRIT.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.203
All right, great job, everyone.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.163
Before I pass it along to
Marcella, we're going to jump

19:36.174 --> 19:39.043
right back into our shoulder
presses, and we're going to

19:39.054 --> 19:40.759
incorporate hook punches.

19:42.940 --> 19:46.919
Let's say five chest presses,
and then we're going to throw

19:46.919 --> 19:48.616
four hook punches.

19:48.648 --> 19:49.035
Okay?

19:49.160 --> 19:50.079
So 1,

19:50.080 --> 19:50.569
2,

19:50.570 --> 19:51.139
3,

19:51.150 --> 19:51.709
4,

19:51.710 --> 19:52.309
5----------

19:52.700 --> 19:53.229
1,

19:53.230 --> 19:53.619
2,

19:53.620 --> 19:54.069
3,

19:54.070 --> 19:54.599
4.

19:55.100 --> 19:55.699
1,

19:55.700 --> 19:56.129
2.

19:56.160 --> 19:56.639
3,

19:56.640 --> 19:57.139
4,

19:57.140 --> 19:57.759
5----------

19:58.090 --> 19:58.749
1,

19:58.890 --> 19:59.389
2,

19:59.390 --> 19:59.779
3,

19:59.780 --> 20:00.209
4.

20:00.466 --> 20:01.329
All right?

20:08.740 --> 20:09.791
Great job, everyone.

20:09.846 --> 20:10.769
Keep it up.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.095
Nice combination, Avery.

20:20.108 --> 20:21.249
Feeling it.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.169
All right, we got 10,

20:28.540 --> 20:29.289
9,

20:30.060 --> 20:30.855
GREAT!

20:31.040 --> 20:31.719
7,

20:32.070 --> 20:32.649
6,

20:33.160 --> 20:33.969
5----------

20:34.180 --> 20:34.909
4,

20:35.410 --> 20:36.209
3,

20:36.640 --> 20:37.449
2,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.499
and SPIRIT.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.869
Awesome job, everyone.

20:42.320 --> 20:45.687
Now I'll pass it along to
Marcella and see what she has up

20:45.698 --> 20:46.269
next.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.403
All right.

20:47.442 --> 20:48.423
Thank you, Avery.

20:48.552 --> 20:52.599
Okay, our next target movement
is going to be our jumping jacks.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.607
So I'm going to be doing the
standing version, which is I'm

20:55.618 --> 20:58.619
going to tap to the side, bring
my arms overhead

20:59.600 --> 21:00.829
right in the middle.

21:02.980 --> 21:05.264
If you're doing the advanced
version, you can follow along

21:05.264 --> 21:06.580
with Kristian.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.209
Nice.

21:15.720 --> 21:16.869
Nice work.

21:20.990 --> 21:22.269
Good job, Avery.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.459
Keep it going for 20 seconds.

21:42.960 --> 21:43.709
10,

21:44.160 --> 21:44.955
9,

21:45.138 --> 21:45.963
GREAT!

21:46.162 --> 21:46.909
7,

21:47.150 --> 21:47.819
6,

21:48.340 --> 21:49.099
5----------

21:49.380 --> 21:50.089
4,

21:50.360 --> 21:51.019
3,

21:51.550 --> 21:52.269
2,

21:52.810 --> 21:54.809
and SPIRIT.

21:55.010 --> 21:55.889
Awesome.

21:56.040 --> 21:56.869
All right,

21:58.440 --> 22:01.231
we're going to do our uppercut,
so we're going to start with

22:01.242 --> 22:02.979
the right uppercut.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.687
You're going to lean on the leg
that is in front of you and

22:06.698 --> 22:10.543
bring that uppercut all the way
through your hips.

22:10.672 --> 22:11.989
All the way through.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.469
So let's do it.

22:16.280 --> 22:17.349
Right uppercuts.

22:23.310 --> 22:24.149
Just like that.

22:24.150 --> 22:25.019
Very good.

22:42.700 --> 22:43.809
Good, Avery.

22:48.270 --> 22:50.999
Okay, let's do our left
uppercuts.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.399
Left.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.989
Good job, everyone.

23:05.710 --> 23:06.789
Keep it going.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.669
All right, let's do them
together.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.409
Right, left, right, left
uppercuts.

23:20.270 --> 23:21.519
All right, let's go.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.169
Right and left, good job.

23:38.740 --> 23:40.179
Good work, Avery.

23:46.140 --> 23:47.259
Excellent.

23:49.580 --> 23:52.119
Keep it going for 20 more
seconds.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.389
10,

24:03.700 --> 24:04.409
9,

24:04.730 --> 24:05.559
GREAT!

24:05.930 --> 24:06.669
7,

24:07.080 --> 24:07.939
6,

24:08.300 --> 24:08.959
5----------

24:09.530 --> 24:10.359
4,

24:10.700 --> 24:11.519
3,

24:12.260 --> 24:12.849
2,

24:13.680 --> 24:15.419
and SPIRIT.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.279
All right, keep moving, guys.

24:17.350 --> 24:21.627
We are going to add the jumping
jack to our punches, so we're

24:21.638 --> 24:24.639
going to do two jumping jacks,
two uppercuts.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.549
So let's try this.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.389
That's 1,

24:29.520 --> 24:30.249
2,

24:30.520 --> 24:31.759
uppercut, uppercut.

24:31.910 --> 24:32.749
1,

24:33.940 --> 24:34.679
2,

24:35.720 --> 24:37.269
uppercut, uppercut.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.349
There you go.

24:45.720 --> 24:46.869
Uppercut,

24:47.110 --> 24:48.179
jumping jacks.

24:52.430 --> 24:53.299
Nice.

24:56.770 --> 24:58.069
Good job, Kristian.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.739
Awesome, Avery.

25:15.830 --> 25:16.799
Nice work.

25:26.780 --> 25:27.489
10,

25:28.100 --> 25:28.939
9,

25:29.640 --> 25:30.429
GREAT!

25:31.280 --> 25:32.029
7,

25:32.430 --> 25:33.269
6,

25:34.350 --> 25:35.139
5----------

25:36.360 --> 25:37.069
4,

25:38.200 --> 25:38.989
3,

25:40.160 --> 25:40.839
2,

25:41.660 --> 25:44.239
and SPIRIT.

25:45.570 --> 25:46.719
Great job.

25:49.700 --> 25:50.543
All right.

25:50.662 --> 25:52.491
Amazing stuff, Marcela.

25:52.556 --> 25:53.403
Good job, Avery.

25:53.452 --> 25:54.529
Good job, everybody.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.319
Awesome work.

25:56.390 --> 26:00.459
That was not easy combining
those exercises with the punches.

26:00.620 --> 26:02.129
Let's go get some water.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.389
Good job, everyone.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.739
Oh, man, that was tough.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.339
Coordination.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.769
Was it easy?

26:18.300 --> 26:19.529
Not at all.

26:20.140 --> 26:22.243
But we did it, Marcela and
Avery, we made it through

26:22.254 --> 26:23.609
everybody, so

26:25.020 --> 26:25.863
we win.

26:25.982 --> 26:28.839
But there's more to come,
everybody, so good job.

26:28.990 --> 26:30.563
That was our first round.

26:30.612 --> 26:33.127
Before we officially take a
break, we're going to pick

26:33.138 --> 26:36.871
ourselves back up and get ready
for our challenge, where we're

26:36.882 --> 26:39.927
going to do 1 minute of an
exercise, and our goal is to

26:39.938 --> 26:43.163
get as many reps of that
exercise as we can.

26:43.202 --> 26:46.969
So what we're going to do is
we're going to do a little side

26:46.980 --> 26:50.111
punching, so you can do this
three different ways.

26:50.166 --> 26:52.959
We got the seated version, we
got Marcela

26:53.720 --> 26:54.899
with the baseline,

26:55.640 --> 26:57.763
and you can do it with me.

26:57.802 --> 27:00.629
So what I'll be doing is a side
step

27:01.240 --> 27:02.419
with a punch.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.855
Side step, punch, punch.

27:06.048 --> 27:08.903
So you're punching to the left
and the right.

27:09.022 --> 27:10.967
You can pick which punch you
want to do.

27:11.054 --> 27:14.889
You can do the jab, you can do
the hook, or the upper cut.

27:15.580 --> 27:19.097
So you're just turning your
body to the side, throwing two

27:19.108 --> 27:21.963
punches, same thing on the
other side.

27:22.162 --> 27:25.176
All right, so each side that
you do, that's going to count

27:25.176 --> 27:26.270
as one.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.603
So in 10 seconds, we're going
to get started and try to get

27:30.614 --> 27:32.479
in as many as we can.

27:32.550 --> 27:35.583
So everybody get into your
stance, get that bounce going.

27:35.702 --> 27:36.769
Let's get ready.

27:41.620 --> 27:42.739
And here we go.

27:42.810 --> 27:43.663
Side punches

27:43.712 --> 27:44.275
in 3,

27:44.378 --> 27:44.883
2,

27:45.002 --> 27:45.427
1,

27:45.514 --> 27:46.549
let's do it.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.869
Nice shot, Marcela.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.099
Good work, Avery.

28:10.640 --> 28:13.629
Awesome job, everybody, keep it
going.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.019
30 seconds, almost there.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.029
20, keep it going, everybody.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.299
Let's try to push a little bit
harder.

28:48.300 --> 28:49.049
10,

28:49.420 --> 28:50.169
9,

28:50.540 --> 28:51.289
GREAT!

28:51.740 --> 28:52.409
7,

28:52.710 --> 28:53.619
6,

28:54.070 --> 28:54.899
5----------

28:55.260 --> 28:56.149
4,

28:56.340 --> 28:57.139
3,

28:57.520 --> 28:58.429
2,

28:58.700 --> 29:00.299
and SPIRIT.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.943
Awesome job, everybody.

29:02.142 --> 29:04.199
Good work, Marcela and Avery.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.631
All right, on that note, let's
go take a break, so pull up

29:08.642 --> 29:09.747
those chairs.

29:09.864 --> 29:12.251
We're going to get about a
minute of resting before we

29:12.262 --> 29:15.809
pick it back up for round
number two.

29:16.180 --> 29:17.311
Way to go, everybody.

29:17.446 --> 29:18.529
Awesome job.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.249
All right, that was fun.

29:27.620 --> 29:30.751
Worked our way through all
three of our punches.

29:30.816 --> 29:34.149
Got a little cardio exercise in
there.

29:35.960 --> 29:39.553
So next step, we're going to
work on some defensive moves

29:39.553 --> 29:43.400
and bring those together to go
along with the punches.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.687
Avery and Marcela, do you two
have a favorite punch of the

29:53.698 --> 29:54.429
three?

29:56.480 --> 29:58.299
I like the jab punch.

29:58.670 --> 30:00.449
Jab punch, okay.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.329
Marcela, which one do you like?

30:03.780 --> 30:05.215
I like it all.

30:05.398 --> 30:06.063
All of them?

30:06.102 --> 30:08.719
Okay, you just like to throw
punches?

30:09.140 --> 30:09.889
Yes.

30:11.540 --> 30:12.629
How about you?

30:14.600 --> 30:17.299
I like the upper cut, I like
the power punch.

30:20.200 --> 30:26.575
Jab is fun, hook is good, but
the upper cut, just bring all

30:26.586 --> 30:29.849
your energy together, and one
boom, that's it, done.

30:30.300 --> 30:33.175
The jab punch is kind of like a
surprising punch, though, right?

30:33.198 --> 30:35.449
So you can snap it real quick,

30:37.920 --> 30:38.909
catch them.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.803
And you don't have to use too
much energy either.

30:41.922 --> 30:42.589
Yeah.

30:46.960 --> 30:49.869
All right, everybody, if you've
got a favorite punch out there,

30:50.720 --> 30:52.619
let us know in the chat.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.775
All right, here we go.

30:55.798 --> 30:57.215
So let's get back into it.

30:57.238 --> 31:00.171
We're going to do round number
two now, and as I said, we're

31:00.182 --> 31:03.247
going to add in some defense to
go along with the moves that we

31:03.258 --> 31:04.275
already worked on.

31:04.378 --> 31:05.411
So let's get to it.

31:05.466 --> 31:07.829
First things first, we're going
to get into our boxing stance,

31:07.829 --> 31:10.470
get those hands up, get that
bounce going.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.591
All right, our first defensive
move, we're going to start off

31:16.602 --> 31:17.843
with the shoulder roll.

31:17.892 --> 31:22.033
So for the shoulder roll, we're
just leaning side to side,

31:22.033 --> 31:24.184
rolling those shoulders left to
right.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.075
Just imagine there's a punch
coming towards your face and

31:27.086 --> 31:30.471
you've got to avoid that punch,
so roll your shoulders as quick

31:30.482 --> 31:33.199
as you can so you don't get hit.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.909
Let's go.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.429
There's Avery doing a great job

31:39.040 --> 31:42.799
with the quick side to side
movement, avoiding those punches.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.155
Good work, everybody.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.987
So we practiced left to right.

31:54.074 --> 31:56.389
Let's do the same thing right
to left.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.447
Awesome, Marcela.

31:58.544 --> 32:00.339
Way to add in the footwork.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.810
All right, everybody, we're
going to keep those shoulder

32:07.810 --> 32:12.227
rolls going, but we're going to
add two jabs and then shoulder

32:12.228 --> 32:12.656
rolls.

32:12.688 --> 32:15.727
So we're going left, right jab,
following it up with the

32:15.738 --> 32:17.139
shoulder rolls.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.149
Good work, everybody.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.889
Jab, jab, shoulder roll.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.675
As Avery mentioned earlier,
after you finish your

32:31.686 --> 32:33.729
combination, make sure you reset.

32:33.814 --> 32:35.327
Get those hands back up.

32:35.414 --> 32:37.567
Cover your face and your body.

32:37.654 --> 32:38.959
Stay protected.

32:40.660 --> 32:41.711
Awesome work, Avery.

32:41.766 --> 32:43.279
Good job, Marcela.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.559
All right, we're going to take
it a step further, everybody.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.015
We're going to add in another
punch.

32:48.048 --> 32:50.927
So we're still keeping our jab,
jab, shoulder roll, but we're

32:50.938 --> 32:53.171
going to add in two hooks at
the end.

32:53.226 --> 32:56.819
So jab, jab, shoulder roll,
shoulder roll, hook, hook.

32:57.980 --> 32:58.969
Let's go.

33:01.420 --> 33:03.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

33:04.060 --> 33:05.223
Nice job with those.

33:05.262 --> 33:06.359
Quick punches.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.619
Quick shoulder rolls.

33:12.560 --> 33:13.675
Awesome, everybody.

33:13.778 --> 33:14.909
We got 10,

33:15.280 --> 33:16.029
9,

33:16.400 --> 33:17.149
GREAT!

33:17.600 --> 33:18.229
7,

33:18.530 --> 33:19.459
6,

33:19.690 --> 33:20.499
5----------

33:20.890 --> 33:21.729
4,

33:21.950 --> 33:22.749
3,

33:23.090 --> 33:23.979
2,

33:24.340 --> 33:26.079
and SPIRIT.

33:26.660 --> 33:27.855
Way to go, everybody.

33:27.958 --> 33:28.849
Good job.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.507
All right, Avery's

33:30.524 --> 33:32.849
going to show us our next move.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.563
All right, Kristian, our next
defensive move that we're going

33:35.574 --> 33:37.663
to practice here today is going
to be the duck.

33:37.792 --> 33:38.115
All right?

33:38.138 --> 33:41.989
So if you're doing it seated
like myself, it's sort of like a

33:42.600 --> 33:43.631
seated crunch.

33:43.696 --> 33:45.283
So I'm just going to duck like
this.

33:45.322 --> 33:46.655
My hands are still going to be
up.

33:46.700 --> 33:49.269
My head is going to be up so I
can see.

33:49.420 --> 33:50.871
I'm going to duck like this.

33:50.926 --> 33:53.091
Okay, let's just practice.

33:53.236 --> 33:56.569
You can check out Marcela and
Kristian if you're standing to

33:56.580 --> 33:57.755
follow along with them.

33:57.778 --> 33:58.349
Okay?

34:02.640 --> 34:04.299
Great job, Marcela.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.191
Remember, when you're ducking,
you still want to keep your

34:09.202 --> 34:10.369
guard up.

34:12.820 --> 34:15.707
Sometimes when you duck, that's
when you get caught with that

34:15.718 --> 34:17.211
uppercut, Kristian.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.289
Oh, yeah.

34:19.780 --> 34:21.009
Hands up, everybody.

34:23.719 --> 34:24.709
Great job.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.036
All right, let's rock this out
for about another 20 seconds,

34:31.036 --> 34:33.219
and then we're going to add
some punches.

34:40.300 --> 34:41.319
Great work, everyone.

34:41.389 --> 34:42.329
Keep it up.

34:47.600 --> 34:48.171
All right.

34:48.226 --> 34:48.923
10,

34:49.121 --> 34:49.869
9,

34:50.320 --> 34:51.069
GREAT!

34:51.440 --> 34:52.169
7,

34:52.489 --> 34:53.218
6,

34:53.830 --> 34:54.549
5----------

34:54.989 --> 34:55.849
4,

34:56.210 --> 34:56.999
3,

34:57.550 --> 34:58.249
2,

34:58.639 --> 34:59.959
and SPIRIT.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.138
All right, we're still going to
keep our guards up.

35:02.210 --> 35:03.959
We're still practicing our duck.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.246
Now, this time around, we're
going to duck, and then we're

35:06.257 --> 35:09.143
going to throw a right hook and
a left hook.

35:09.190 --> 35:12.999
Okay, so we're going to duck,
right, left.

35:13.080 --> 35:16.649
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

35:16.710 --> 35:19.759
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

35:23.390 --> 35:25.429
Great job transitioning,
everyone.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.179
Good work, Kristian.

35:40.470 --> 35:41.369
Excellent.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.139
Great job, Marcela.

35:50.660 --> 35:52.399
All right, 20 seconds.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.947
All right, let's finish it out
strong, everyone.

36:07.034 --> 36:07.669
10,

36:08.200 --> 36:08.949
9,

36:09.400 --> 36:10.149
GREAT!

36:10.760 --> 36:11.489
7,

36:11.920 --> 36:12.649
6,

36:13.470 --> 36:14.269
5----------

36:14.980 --> 36:15.829
4,

36:16.460 --> 36:17.359
3,

36:18.040 --> 36:18.889
2,

36:19.180 --> 36:20.595
and SPIRIT.

36:20.708 --> 36:24.115
All right, we're going to keep
that same process going, but

36:24.126 --> 36:25.575
this time we're going to

36:25.660 --> 36:30.649
duck, hook, hook, duck again,
right uppercut, left uppercut.

36:30.706 --> 36:32.859
Okay, so that's going to be a
duck,

36:33.360 --> 36:35.879
hook, hook, another duck,

36:36.040 --> 36:37.387
uppercut, upper cut.

36:37.474 --> 36:38.109
Okay?

36:38.800 --> 36:43.799
Duck, hook, hook, duck again,
uppercut, uppercut.

36:43.890 --> 36:44.239
Great.

36:44.310 --> 36:45.329
Just like that.

36:48.980 --> 36:50.399
30 seconds.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.589
Let's knock it out.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.299
Literally.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.219
Great work, Kristian.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.119
Great job, Marcela.

37:15.420 --> 37:17.319
All right, 15 seconds.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.091
All right.

37:26.146 --> 37:26.843
10,

37:27.042 --> 37:27.789
9,

37:28.240 --> 37:28.989
GREAT!

37:29.540 --> 37:30.379
7,

37:30.610 --> 37:31.319
6,

37:31.920 --> 37:32.629
5----------

37:33.240 --> 37:33.999
4,

37:34.540 --> 37:35.309
3,

37:36.140 --> 37:36.969
2,

37:37.380 --> 37:38.959
and SPIRIT.

37:40.020 --> 37:41.087
Great work, everyone.

37:41.174 --> 37:42.143
Great work.

37:42.342 --> 37:44.849
All right, Marcela, what do you
have for us next?

37:45.220 --> 37:48.419
All right, our next defense
move is going to be the block.

37:48.540 --> 37:52.590
So for this one, try to bring
those elbows together right in

37:52.602 --> 37:54.629
front of our face to protect.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.383
So we're going to start first
with our blocks.

37:58.512 --> 38:00.099
Side to side blocks.

38:03.160 --> 38:03.619
Again.

38:03.690 --> 38:04.869
Just like that.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.709
Very good.

38:18.710 --> 38:19.799
Good job, Kristian.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.619
Nice, Avery.

38:36.520 --> 38:39.903
We're going to keep going with
this block, and we're going to

38:39.914 --> 38:42.419
add some punches to the block.

38:43.160 --> 38:45.939
Let's do that for another 10
seconds,

38:46.600 --> 38:47.339
9,

38:47.900 --> 38:48.709
GREAT!

38:49.150 --> 38:49.919
7,

38:50.430 --> 38:51.259
6,

38:51.660 --> 38:52.429
5----------

38:52.890 --> 38:53.689
4,

38:54.150 --> 38:54.909
3,

38:55.500 --> 38:56.259
2,

38:56.540 --> 38:58.359
and SPIRIT.

38:58.540 --> 39:00.507
Good job, everyone, keep moving.

39:00.674 --> 39:02.555
Time for our uppercuts.

39:02.660 --> 39:06.239
So we're going to do a block,
uppercut, uppercut.

39:07.060 --> 39:09.549
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

39:12.260 --> 39:13.239
Nice.

39:13.380 --> 39:15.709
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

39:20.110 --> 39:21.079
Excellent.

39:29.080 --> 39:29.839
Block,

39:30.840 --> 39:31.919
and uppercuts.

39:32.410 --> 39:33.719
Looking good, Avery.

39:33.720 --> 39:34.629
Good job.

39:41.410 --> 39:42.879
Nice, Kristian.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.009
Good job, Marcela.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.309
Get ready to add another punch.

39:50.800 --> 39:51.759
So we're going to do

39:51.760 --> 39:55.819
block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

39:56.260 --> 40:01.469
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

40:02.260 --> 40:05.739
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

40:05.800 --> 40:06.899
There we go.

40:14.230 --> 40:15.899
A lot to think in here.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.049
Nice work.

40:23.700 --> 40:25.209
Good job, Kristian.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.829
Nice, keep it up, keep it up,
almost there.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.179
10,

40:36.020 --> 40:36.789
9,

40:37.510 --> 40:38.299
GREAT!

40:38.800 --> 40:39.589
7,

40:39.940 --> 40:40.789
6,

40:41.370 --> 40:42.099
5----------

40:43.000 --> 40:43.819
4,

40:44.330 --> 40:45.099
3,

40:47.780 --> 40:49.379
SPIRIT.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.199
Awesome.

40:53.060 --> 40:53.919
All right.

40:54.070 --> 40:56.011
Way to go, Marcela.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.689
Way to go, Avery.

40:58.908 --> 41:01.151
That was a real workout,
everybody.

41:01.286 --> 41:02.483
Good job.

41:02.522 --> 41:04.869
Let's go get another quick sip
of water.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.587
All right, congratulations,
everybody.

41:13.674 --> 41:17.375
We made it to the finish line,
and we did it with style.

41:17.488 --> 41:19.735
You all did an amazing job
today.

41:19.918 --> 41:22.146
So what we're going to do next,
we're going to finish it off

41:22.158 --> 41:25.186
with some cool down stretches
so we can relax all those

41:25.198 --> 41:27.879
muscles that we fired up today.

41:28.030 --> 41:30.983
Our first stretch, we're going
to start off with the side bend.

41:31.032 --> 41:32.103
We're going to get our core.

41:32.152 --> 41:34.279
We did a lot of twisting and
turning.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.469
We're going to

41:36.080 --> 41:41.125
help those muscles relax by
bringing one arm up and over

41:41.125 --> 41:43.250
and leaning to the opposite side.

41:44.260 --> 41:46.399
We'll hold it for 10 seconds

41:47.140 --> 41:48.619
and then switch.

41:53.720 --> 41:54.467
3,

41:54.634 --> 41:55.395
2,

41:55.578 --> 41:57.443
and switch it up.

41:57.562 --> 41:59.509
Same thing on the other side.

42:10.680 --> 42:11.409
5----------

42:11.610 --> 42:12.409
4,

42:12.510 --> 42:13.249
3,

42:13.270 --> 42:14.079
2,

42:14.170 --> 42:15.003
and SPIRIT.

42:15.072 --> 42:15.543
Good job.

42:15.582 --> 42:17.282
Now we're going to take both
hands and we're going to reach

42:17.294 --> 42:20.551
them down towards the floor,
and we're going to hold it.

42:20.606 --> 42:23.670
If you're standing up, try to
keep those legs nice and

42:23.682 --> 42:24.619
straight.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.139
Reach down towards the floor.

42:38.020 --> 42:38.829
5----------

42:39.010 --> 42:39.739
4,

42:39.940 --> 42:40.659
3,

42:40.830 --> 42:41.599
2,

42:41.670 --> 42:42.523
and SPIRIT.

42:42.572 --> 42:43.119
Good job.

42:43.190 --> 42:44.079
Last one, everybody.

42:44.150 --> 42:46.993
We're going to reach in the
opposite direction now, hands

42:46.993 --> 42:48.292
up above our head.

42:48.346 --> 42:51.155
Get those shoulders and arms
stretched out.

42:51.178 --> 42:53.316
If you want to get your lower
back in the mix, you could push

42:53.328 --> 42:55.369
your hips forward and lean back.

42:59.340 --> 43:01.943
And we'll hold it for 10,

43:02.142 --> 43:02.983
9,

43:03.182 --> 43:03.975
GREAT!

43:04.160 --> 43:04.929
7,

43:05.010 --> 43:05.879
6,

43:06.040 --> 43:06.759
5----------

43:06.990 --> 43:07.769
4,

43:07.910 --> 43:08.649
3,

43:08.770 --> 43:09.539
2,

43:09.710 --> 43:11.519
and SPIRIT.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.549
Awesome job today, everybody.

43:14.560 --> 43:15.527
Great work, Avery.

43:15.544 --> 43:17.095
Good job, Marcela.

43:17.288 --> 43:19.415
Awesome work, Kristian and
Avery.

43:19.528 --> 43:22.055
And all of you, great job.

43:22.248 --> 43:23.403
Great job, everyone.

43:23.522 --> 43:24.615
Great work, Marcella.

43:24.648 --> 43:27.949
Great work, Kristian, awesome
class, love the energy.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.711
Lots of fun as always,
everybody, thank you all again

43:33.722 --> 43:35.971
for being a part of this thing
with us.

43:36.106 --> 43:38.803
We appreciate you, and we look
forward to seeing you next time.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.879
So everybody take care and we
will catch up with you soon.
