00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.759
Great job, Kristian.

1
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.509
All right, we're going to
switch to our left,

2
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.049
just left hook punches only.

3
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.719
Great job, Marcela.

4
00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.943
All right, let's get a few more
in and then we're going to put

5
00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:33.068
them both together.

6
00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.019
All right, let's put them both
together.

7
00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:42.749
That's going to be a right and
a left.

8
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.749
Great job transitioning, guys.

9
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.509
Keep it up.

10
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.119
Great job, everyone.

11
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.049
Keep going.

12
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.051
Don't stop.

13
00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:21.947
Don't think about it.

14
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.559
Just keep throwing those
punches.

15
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.317
All right, let's get ready to
put four of them together,

16
00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:34.110
everyone.

17
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.899
So it's going to be

18
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.269
1,

19
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.759
2,

20
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.209
3,

21
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.779
4.

22
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.339
Four quick hook punches.

23
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.339
Great job, Marcela.

24
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.289
All right, let's go for 30
seconds, let's finish it out.

25
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.619
And remember, you want to reset
after you throw your punches.

26
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.831
Hands back up, four punches.

27
00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.379
Hands up, four punches.

28
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.415
All right, we got 10,

29
00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:31.423
9,

30
00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:32.369
GREAT!

31
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.409

32
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.649

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.139
and SPIRIT.

38
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.203
All right, great job, everyone.

39
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.163
Before I pass it along to
Marcella, we're going to jump

40
00:02:46.174 --> 00:02:49.043
right back into our shoulder
presses, and we're going to

41
00:02:49.054 --> 00:02:50.759
incorporate hook punches.

42
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.919
Let's say five chest presses,
and then we're going to throw

43
00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.616
four hook punches.

44
00:02:58.648 --> 00:02:59.035
Okay?

45
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.079
So 1,

46
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.569

47
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.139

3,

62
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.209
4.

63
00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:11.329
All right?

64
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.791
Great job, everyone.

65
00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:20.769
Keep it up.

66
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.095
Nice combination, Avery.

67
00:03:30.108 --> 00:03:31.249
Feeling it.

68
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.169
All right, we got 10,

69
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.289
9,

70
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.855
GREAT!

71
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.719

and SPIRIT.

78
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.869
Awesome job, everyone.

79
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.687
Now I'll pass it along to
Marcella and see what she has up

80
00:03:55.698 --> 00:03:56.269
next.

81
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.403
All right.

82
00:03:57.442 --> 00:03:58.423
Thank you, Avery.

83
00:03:58.552 --> 00:04:02.599
Okay, our next target movement
is going to be our jumping jacks.

84
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.607
So I'm going to be doing the
standing version, which is I'm

85
00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:08.619
going to tap to the side, bring
my arms overhead

86
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.829
right in the middle.

87
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.264
If you're doing the advanced
version, you can follow along

88
00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:16.580
with Kristian.

89
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.209
Nice.

90
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.869
Nice work.

91
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.269
Good job, Avery.

92
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.459
Keep it going for 20 seconds.

93
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.709
10,

94
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.955
9,

95
00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:55.963
GREAT!

96
00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:56.909
7,

97
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.819

and SPIRIT.

103
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.889
Awesome.

104
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.869
All right,

105
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.231
we're going to do our uppercut,
so we're going to start with

106
00:05:11.242 --> 00:05:12.979
the right uppercut.

107
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.687
You're going to lean on the leg
that is in front of you and

108
00:05:16.698 --> 00:05:20.543
bring that uppercut all the way
through your hips.

109
00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:21.989
All the way through.

110
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.469
So let's do it.

111
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.349
Right uppercuts.

112
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.149
Just like that.

113
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.019
Very good.

114
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.809
Good, Avery.

115
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.999
Okay, let's do our left
uppercuts.

116
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.399
Left.

117
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.989
Good job, everyone.

118
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.789
Keep it going.

119
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.669
All right, let's do them
together.

120
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.409
Right, left, right, left
uppercuts.

121
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.519
All right, let's go.

122
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.169
Right and left, good job.

123
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.179
Good work, Avery.

124
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.259
Excellent.

125
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.119
Keep it going for 20 more
seconds.

126
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.389
10,

127
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.409

and SPIRIT.

136
00:07:25.622 --> 00:07:27.279
All right, keep moving, guys.

137
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.627
We are going to add the jumping
jack to our punches, so we're

138
00:07:31.638 --> 00:07:34.639
going to do two jumping jacks,
two uppercuts.

139
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.549
So let's try this.

140
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.389
That's 1,

141
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.249
2,

142
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.759
uppercut, uppercut.

uppercut, uppercut.

146
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.349
There you go.

147
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.869
Uppercut,

148
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.179
jumping jacks.

149
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.299
Nice.

150
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.069
Good job, Kristian.

151
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.739
Awesome, Avery.

All right.

00:09:00.662 --> 00:09:02.491
Amazing stuff, Marcela.

166
00:09:02.556 --> 00:09:03.403
Good job, Avery.

Good job, everybody.

168
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.319
Awesome work.

169
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.459
That was not easy combining
those exercises with the punches.

170
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.129
Let's go get some water.

171
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.389
Good job, everyone.

172
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.739
Oh, man, that was tough.

173
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.339
Coordination.

174
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.769
Was it easy?

175
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.529
Not at all.

176
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.243
But we did it, Marcela and
Avery, we made it through

177
00:09:32.254 --> 00:09:33.609
everybody, so

178
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.863
we win.

179
00:09:35.982 --> 00:09:38.839
But there's more to come,
everybody, so good job.

180
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.563
That was our first round.

181
00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:43.127
Before we officially take a
break, we're going to pick

182
00:09:43.138 --> 00:09:46.871
ourselves back up and get ready
for our challenge, where we're

183
00:09:46.882 --> 00:09:49.927
going to do 1 minute of an
exercise, and our goal is to

184
00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:53.163
get as many reps of that
exercise as we can.

185
00:09:53.202 --> 00:09:56.969
So what we're going to do is
we're going to do a little side

186
00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.111
punching, so you can do this
three different ways.

187
00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.959
We got the seated version, we
got Marcela

188
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.899
with the baseline,

189
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.763
and you can do it with me.

190
00:10:07.802 --> 00:10:10.629
So what I'll be doing is a side
step

191
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.419
with a punch.

192
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.855
Side step, punch, punch.

193
00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:18.903
So you're punching to the left
and the right.

194
00:10:19.022 --> 00:10:20.967
You can pick which punch you
want to do.

195
00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:24.889
You can do the jab, you can do
the hook, or the upper cut.

196
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.097
So you're just turning your
body to the side, throwing two

197
00:10:29.108 --> 00:10:31.963
punches, same thing on the
other side.

198
00:10:32.162 --> 00:10:35.176
All right, so each side that
you do, that's going to count

199
00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.270
as one.

200
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.603
So in 10 seconds, we're going
to get started and try to get

201
00:10:40.614 --> 00:10:42.479
in as many as we can.

202
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.583
So everybody get into your
stance, get that bounce going.

203
00:10:45.702 --> 00:10:46.769
Let's get ready.

204
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.739
And here we go.

205
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.663
Side punches

206
00:10:53.712 --> 00:10:54.275
in 3,

207
00:10:54.378 --> 00:10:54.883
2,

208
00:10:55.002 --> 00:10:55.427
1,

209
00:10:55.514 --> 00:10:56.549
let's do it.

210
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.869
Nice shot, Marcela.

211
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.099
Good work, Avery.

212
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.629
Awesome job, everybody, keep it
going.

213
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.019
30 seconds, almost there.

214
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.029
20, keep it going, everybody.

215
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.299
Let's try to push a little bit
harder.

216
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.049
10,

217
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.169
9,

218
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.289
GREAT!

219
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.409
7,

220
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:03.619
6,

221
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:04.899
5----------

222
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.149
4,

223
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.139
3,

224
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.429
2,

225
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.299
and SPIRIT.

226
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.943
Awesome job, everybody.

227
00:12:12.142 --> 00:12:14.199
Good work, Marcela and Avery.

228
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.631
All right, on that note, let's
go take a break, so pull up

229
00:12:18.642 --> 00:12:19.747
those chairs.

230
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.251
We're going to get about a
minute of resting before we

231
00:12:22.262 --> 00:12:25.809
pick it back up for round
number two.

232
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.311
Way to go, everybody.

233
00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:28.529
Awesome job.

234
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.249
All right, that was fun.

235
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.751
Worked our way through all
three of our punches.

236
00:12:40.816 --> 00:12:44.149
Got a little cardio exercise in
there.

237
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.553
So next step, we're going to
work on some defensive moves

238
00:12:49.553 --> 00:12:53.400
and bring those together to go
along with the punches.

239
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.687
Avery and Marcela, do you two
have a favorite punch of the

240
00:13:03.698 --> 00:13:04.429
three?

241
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.299
I like the jab punch.

242
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.449
Jab punch, okay.

243
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.329
Marcela, which one do you like?

244
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.215
I like it all.

245
00:13:15.398 --> 00:13:16.063
All of them?

246
00:13:16.102 --> 00:13:18.719
Okay, you just like to throw
punches?

247
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:19.889
Yes.

248
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.629
How about you?

249
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.299
I like the upper cut, I like
the power punch.

250
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.575
Jab is fun, hook is good, but
the upper cut, just bring all

251
00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:39.849
your energy together, and one
boom, that's it, done.

252
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.175
The jab punch is kind of like a
surprising punch, though, right?

253
00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.449
So you can snap it real quick,

254
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.909
catch them.

255
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.803
And you don't have to use too
much energy either.

256
00:13:51.922 --> 00:13:52.589
Yeah.

257
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.869
All right, everybody, if you've
got a favorite punch out there,

258
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.619
let us know in the chat.

259
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.775
All right, here we go.

260
00:14:05.798 --> 00:14:07.215
So let's get back into it.

261
00:14:07.238 --> 00:14:10.171
We're going to do round number
two now, and as I said, we're

262
00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:13.247
going to add in some defense to
go along with the moves that we

263
00:14:13.258 --> 00:14:14.275
already worked on.

264
00:14:14.378 --> 00:14:15.411
So let's get to it.

265
00:14:15.466 --> 00:14:17.829
First things first, we're going
to get into our boxing stance,

266
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:20.470
get those hands up, get that
bounce going.

267
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.591
All right, our first defensive
move, we're going to start off

268
00:14:26.602 --> 00:14:27.843
with the shoulder roll.

269
00:14:27.892 --> 00:14:32.033
So for the shoulder roll, we're
just leaning side to side,

270
00:14:32.033 --> 00:14:34.184
rolling those shoulders left to
right.

271
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.075
Just imagine there's a punch
coming towards your face and

272
00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:40.471
you've got to avoid that punch,
so roll your shoulders as quick

273
00:14:40.482 --> 00:14:43.199
as you can so you don't get hit.

274
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.909
Let's go.

275
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.429
There's Avery doing a great job

276
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.799
with the quick side to side
movement, avoiding those punches.

277
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.155
Good work, everybody.

278
00:15:02.278 --> 00:15:03.987
So we practiced left to right.

279
00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:06.389
Let's do the same thing right
to left.

280
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.447
Awesome, Marcela.

281
00:15:08.544 --> 00:15:10.339
Way to add in the footwork.

282
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.810
All right, everybody, we're
going to keep those shoulder

283
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.227
rolls going, but we're going to
add two jabs and then shoulder

284
00:15:22.228 --> 00:15:22.656
rolls.

285
00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:25.727
So we're going left, right jab,
following it up with the

286
00:15:25.738 --> 00:15:27.139
shoulder rolls.

287
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.149
Good work, everybody.

288
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.889
Jab, jab, shoulder roll.

289
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.675
As Avery mentioned earlier,
after you finish your

290
00:15:41.686 --> 00:15:43.729
combination, make sure you reset.

291
00:15:43.814 --> 00:15:45.327
Get those hands back up.

292
00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:47.567
Cover your face and your body.

293
00:15:47.654 --> 00:15:48.959
Stay protected.

294
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.711
Awesome work, Avery.

295
00:15:51.766 --> 00:15:53.279
Good job, Marcela.

296
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.559
All right, we're going to take
it a step further, everybody.

297
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.015
We're going to add in another
punch.

298
00:15:58.048 --> 00:16:00.927
So we're still keeping our jab,
jab, shoulder roll, but we're

299
00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:03.171
going to add in two hooks at
the end.

300
00:16:03.226 --> 00:16:06.819
So jab, jab, shoulder roll,
shoulder roll, hook, hook.

301
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:08.969
Let's go.

302
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

303
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.223
Nice job with those.

304
00:16:15.262 --> 00:16:16.359
Quick punches.

305
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.619
Quick shoulder rolls.

306
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.675
Awesome, everybody.

307
00:16:23.778 --> 00:16:24.909
We got 10,

308
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.029
9,

309
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.149
GREAT!

310
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.229
7,

311
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.459
6,

312
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:30.499
5----------

313
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:31.729
4,

314
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:32.749
3,

315
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:33.979
2,

316
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.079
and SPIRIT.

317
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.855
Way to go, everybody.

318
00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:38.849
Good job.

319
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.507
All right, Avery's

320
00:16:40.524 --> 00:16:42.849
going to show us our next move.

321
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.563
All right, Kristian, our next
defensive move that we're going

322
00:16:45.574 --> 00:16:47.663
to practice here today is going
to be the duck.

323
00:16:47.792 --> 00:16:48.115
All right?

324
00:16:48.138 --> 00:16:51.989
So if you're doing it seated
like myself, it's sort of like a

325
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.631
seated crunch.

326
00:16:53.696 --> 00:16:55.283
So I'm just going to duck like
this.

327
00:16:55.322 --> 00:16:56.655
My hands are still going to be
up.

328
00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.269
My head is going to be up so I
can see.

329
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.871
I'm going to duck like this.

330
00:17:00.926 --> 00:17:03.091
Okay, let's just practice.

331
00:17:03.236 --> 00:17:06.569
You can check out Marcela and
Kristian if you're standing to

332
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.755
follow along with them.

333
00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:08.349
Okay?

334
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.299
Great job, Marcela.

335
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.191
Remember, when you're ducking,
you still want to keep your

336
00:17:19.202 --> 00:17:20.369
guard up.

337
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.707
Sometimes when you duck, that's
when you get caught with that

338
00:17:25.718 --> 00:17:27.211
uppercut, Kristian.

339
00:17:27.356 --> 00:17:28.289
Oh, yeah.

340
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.009
Hands up, everybody.

341
00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:34.709
Great job.

342
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.036
All right, let's rock this out
for about another 20 seconds,

343
00:17:41.036 --> 00:17:43.219
and then we're going to add
some punches.

344
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.319
Great work, everyone.

345
00:17:51.389 --> 00:17:52.329
Keep it up.

346
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.171
All right.

347
00:17:58.226 --> 00:17:58.923
10,

348
00:17:59.121 --> 00:17:59.869
9,

349
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.069
GREAT!

350
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.169
7,

351
00:18:02.489 --> 00:18:03.218
6,

352
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:04.549
5----------

00:18:04.989 --> 00:18:05.849

and SPIRIT.

357
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.138
All right, we're still going to
keep our guards up.

358
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.959
We're still practicing our duck.

359
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.246
Now, this time around, we're
going to duck, and then we're

360
00:18:16.257 --> 00:18:19.143
going to throw a right hook and
a left hook.

361
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.999
Okay, so we're going to duck,
right, left.

362
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.649
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

363
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.759
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

364
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.429
Great job transitioning,
everyone.

365
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.179
Good work, Kristian.

366
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:51.369
Excellent.

367
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.139
Great job, Marcela.

368
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.399
All right, 20 seconds.

369
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.947
All right, let's finish it out
strong, everyone.

370
00:19:17.034 --> 00:19:17.669
10,

371
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.949
9,

372
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.149
GREAT!

and SPIRIT.

380
00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:34.115
All right, we're going to keep
that same process going, but

381
00:19:34.126 --> 00:19:35.575
this time we're going to

382
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.649
duck, hook, hook, duck again,
right uppercut, left uppercut.

383
00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:42.859
Okay, so that's going to be a
duck,

384
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.879
hook, hook, another duck,

385
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.387
uppercut, upper cut.

386
00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:48.109
Okay?

387
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.799
Duck, hook, hook, duck again,
uppercut, uppercut.

388
00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:54.239
Great.

389
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.329
Just like that.

390
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.399
30 seconds.

391
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.589
Let's knock it out.

392
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.299
Literally.

393
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.219
Great work, Kristian.

394
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.119
Great job, Marcela.

395
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.319
All right, 15 seconds.

396
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.091
All right.

397
00:20:36.146 --> 00:20:36.843
10,

398
00:20:37.042 --> 00:20:37.789
9,

399
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.989
GREAT!

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.319

407
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.087
Great work, everyone.

408
00:20:51.174 --> 00:20:52.143
Great work.

409
00:20:52.342 --> 00:20:54.849
All right, Marcela, what do you
have for us next?

410
00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.419
All right, our next defense
move is going to be the block.

411
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.590
So for this one, try to bring
those elbows together right in

412
00:21:02.602 --> 00:21:04.629
front of our face to protect.

413
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.383
So we're going to start first
with our blocks.

414
00:21:08.512 --> 00:21:10.099
Side to side blocks.

415
00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:13.619
Again.

416
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.869
Just like that.

417
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.709
Very good.

418
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.799
Good job, Kristian.

419
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.619
Nice, Avery.

420
00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.903
We're going to keep going with
this block, and we're going to

421
00:21:49.914 --> 00:21:52.419
add some punches to the block.

422
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.939
Let's do that for another 10
seconds,

423
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.339
9,

424
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.709
GREAT!

425
00:21:59.150 --> 00:21:59.919

426
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.259

and SPIRIT.

432
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.507
Good job, everyone, keep moving.

433
00:22:10.674 --> 00:22:12.555
Time for our uppercuts.

434
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.239
So we're going to do a block,
uppercut, uppercut.

435
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.549
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

436
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.239
Nice.

437
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.709
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

438
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.079
Excellent.

439
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:39.839
Block,

440
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.919
and uppercuts.

441
00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:43.719
Looking good, Avery.

442
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.629
Good job.

443
00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:52.879
Nice, Kristian.

444
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.009
Good job, Marcela.

445
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.309
Get ready to add another punch.

446
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.759
So we're going to do

447
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.819
block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

448
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:11.469
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

449
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.739
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

450
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.899
There we go.

451
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.899
A lot to think in here.

452
00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.049
Nice work.

453
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.209
Good job, Kristian.

454
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.829
Nice, keep it up, keep it up,
almost there.

Awesome.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:03.919
All right.

466
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.011
Way to go, Marcela.

467
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.689
Way to go, Avery.

468
00:24:08.908 --> 00:24:11.151
That was a real workout,
everybody.

469
00:24:11.286 --> 00:24:12.483
Good job.

470
00:24:12.522 --> 00:24:14.869
Let's go get another quick sip
of water.

471
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.587
All right, congratulations,
everybody.

472
00:24:23.674 --> 00:24:27.375
We made it to the finish line,
and we did it with style.

473
00:24:27.488 --> 00:24:29.735
You all did an amazing job
today.

474
00:24:29.918 --> 00:24:32.146
So what we're going to do next,
we're going to finish it off

475
00:24:32.158 --> 00:24:35.186
with some cool down stretches
so we can relax all those

476
00:24:35.198 --> 00:24:37.879
muscles that we fired up today.

477
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.983
Our first stretch, we're going
to start off with the side bend.

478
00:24:41.032 --> 00:24:42.103
We're going to get our core.

479
00:24:42.152 --> 00:24:44.279
We did a lot of twisting and
turning.

480
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.469
We're going to

481
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:51.125
help those muscles relax by
bringing one arm up and over

482
00:24:51.125 --> 00:24:53.250
and leaning to the opposite side.

483
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.399
We'll hold it for 10 seconds

484
00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.619
and then switch.

485
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.467

486
00:25:04.634 --> 00:25:05.395
2,

487
00:25:05.578 --> 00:25:07.443
and switch it up.

488
00:25:07.562 --> 00:25:09.509
Same thing on the other side.

Good job.

495
00:25:25.582 --> 00:25:27.282
Now we're going to take both
hands and we're going to reach

496
00:25:27.294 --> 00:25:30.551
them down towards the floor,
and we're going to hold it.

497
00:25:30.606 --> 00:25:33.670
If you're standing up, try to
keep those legs nice and

498
00:25:33.682 --> 00:25:34.619
straight.

499
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.139
Reach down towards the floor.

Good job.

506
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.079
Last one, everybody.

507
00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:56.993
We're going to reach in the
opposite direction now, hands

508
00:25:56.993 --> 00:25:58.292
up above our head.

509
00:25:58.346 --> 00:26:01.155
Get those shoulders and arms
stretched out.

510
00:26:01.178 --> 00:26:03.316
If you want to get your lower
back in the mix, you could push

511
00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:05.369
your hips forward and lean back.

512
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.943
And we'll hold it for 10,

513
00:26:12.142 --> 00:26:12.983

514

516
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:15.879
6,

517
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.759
5----------

2,

521
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.519
