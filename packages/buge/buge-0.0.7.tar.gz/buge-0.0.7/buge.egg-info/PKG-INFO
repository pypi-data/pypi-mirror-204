# buge
*Think BUG-E, except I pronounce it 'booj'*

## Description

buge is a command-line application that helps developers understand and troubleshoot common error messages by generating explanations and solutions using the OpenAI GPT-3 language model.

## Instructions

1. Install buge by entering `pip3 install buge` in your terminal.
2. Call buge from anywhere in your terminal by entering `buge`.
3. If it's your first time calling buge, you will be prompted for you OpenAI API key. You'll only need to do this once.
4. You'll then be prompted for your error code. Paste you error code into your terminal and hit 'enter'.
5. buge makes an API call and then returns the the meaning of the error code, possible causes, and possible solutions.

This program is free to use. However, if you would like to <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/damonpickett" target="_blank">buy me a coffee</a>, I would appreciate it :)

## Dependencies

- [OpenAI](https://pypi.org/project/openai/): A cloud-based platform that allows users to build various artificial intelligence models, including natural language processing models that can generate text.
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/): Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables. It helps in the development of applications following the [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) principles.
- [rich package](https://pypi.org/project/rich): Rich is a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.

## How buge Works

1. Upon running the program, buge first checks your OpenAI API key in your `.env` file. If this file does not exist, buge prompts the user for their key, creates the file, and writes the key to the file. The .env file is then saved in the package folder.
2. buge then prompts the user for their error code.
3. buge takes the user's error code and passes it to the `get_error_explanation()` function as a parameter. This function makes three API calls based on the user's error code. It asks `text-davinci-003` for the meaning of the error code, possible causes for the error code, and possible solutions. It then prints the results to the user's console. I chose to use three seperate API calls as opposed to asking for everything at once to ensure that everything being asked for would be given its proper due by GPT-3. Bunching everything together in one prompt would have caused mixed results for users.
