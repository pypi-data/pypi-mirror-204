Installation
============

Python version
--------------

We recommend to use the last version of Python 3.  If you don't have Python
installed we recommend installing it using the `Anaconda`_ distribution .

.. _Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/


Install TidyMS
--------------

If you already have Python, you can install TidyMS from the Python Package
Index:

On Linux:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install tidyms

On Windows, if you are using Anaconda and didn't add Python to the PATH
environment variable you have to run this command from the conda prompt.
