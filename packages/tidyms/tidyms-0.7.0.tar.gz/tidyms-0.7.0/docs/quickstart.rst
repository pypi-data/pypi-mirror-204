Quickstart
==========

TidyMS [1]_ is a Python package that provides tools to process and analyze
Mass Spectrometry (MS) data. Although suited for general use, it was designed
to be used with datasets from LC-HRMS metabolomics experiments. It uses
`Numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_, `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ and
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_ for data processing and analysis.
Some of the functionality that offers is:

-   read raw data in the mzML format using :class:`tidyms.MSData` class, optimized for speed and low memory usage.
-   Creation of chromatograms and accumulated spectra from raw data.
-   :term:`Feature detection<feature detection>` and :term:`feature correspondence` in metabolomics datasets using the :class:`tidyms.Assay` class.
-   Read processed data from other mass spectrometry processing software (XCMS, mzmine2, etc...).
-   A container object to manage metabolomics data.
-   :term:`Data curation<data curation>` of untargeted metabolomics data sets using widely accepted practices from the metabolomics community [2]_ [3]_
-   Interactive data visualization using `bokeh <https://bokeh.org/>`_, or publication quality plots using `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_.

In the rest of this guide, you can find links for different use cases for the
TidyMS package. A basic knowledge of MS and metabolomics is assumed, but you can
look up in the :doc:`glossary` the concepts used in the guides.
Installation instructions are available :doc:`here<installation>`.

You can refer to the following guides to learn about specific topics:
