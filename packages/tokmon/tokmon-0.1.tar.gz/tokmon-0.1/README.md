# `tokmon` üî§üßê - CLI utility to monitor OpenAI token costs

`tokmon` enables you to monitor your program's OpenAI API token usage.

You use `tokmon` just like you would use the `time` utility, but instead of execution time you get token usage and cost.

## Quick install
Install using `pip` like so:
```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/yagil/tokmon.git
$ tokmon --help
```

To uninstall, run `pip uninstall tokmon`<br>
Tip: make sure that the your python Library route is in your `PATH`.

## How to use `tokmon`

> **Warning**
> This is a debugging tool. It is not intended to be used in any consequential setting. Use your best judgement, you're on your own!

Prepend `tokmon` to your normal program invocation like so:
```bash
$ tokmon ./my_gpt_program --my_arg "hi"
```
Run and use your program just like you would normally (arguments and all). Interactive usage is supported as well.

After your program finishes running (or you `ctrl^C` it), `tokmon` will automatically generate a cost report that looks like this:

### Short usage summary
```yaml
tokmon cost report:
================================================================================
Monitored invocation: ./python_example.py -i
Models: ['gpt-3.5-turbo-0301']
Total Usage: {'total_prompt_tokens': 49, 'total_completion_tokens': 44, 'total_tokens': 93}
Pricing: {'gpt-3.5-turbo-0301': {'prompt_cost': 0.002, 'completion_cost': 0.002, 'per_tokens': 1000}}
Total Cost: $0.000186
================================================================================

Writing cost summary to JSON file: /tmp/tokmon_usage_summary_1681426650.json
```
- If your program uses multiple OpenAI models in the same invocation, their respective usages will be reflected in the report.
- You can run multiple instances of `tokmon` simultaneously. Each invocation will generate a separate usage report.
- Pass a `--json_out /your/path/report.json` to get a detailed breakdown + conversation history in JSON format.

### Full usage and cost summary (JSON)

```json

        "total_prompt_tokens": 18,

        "total_tokens": 41
    },
    "pricing_data": "{'gpt-4-0314': {'prompt_cost': 0.03, 'completion_cost': 0.06, 'per_tokens': 1000}}",

                "completion_tokens": 23,

            },
            "cost": 0.0019199999999999998,
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You're a helpful assistant."
                },
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "hello"
                },
                {
                    "role": "assistant",
                    "content": "Hello! How can I help you today? If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask."
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## How it works
`tokmon` uses the [mitmproxy library](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy) to intercept HTTP requests and responses between your program and the OpenAI API.
It then processes the request and response data to calculate token usage and cost based on [tokmon/pricing.json](tokmon/pricing.json).

> `tokmon` works for programs in `python` / `node` (using OpenAI's clients), or `curl` (run directly, and not i.e. in a bash script).

> if you [manually install `mitmproxy`'s CA certificate](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-certificates/#:~:text=Go%20to%20Settings%20%3E%20General%20%3E%20About,trust%20for%20the%20mitmproxy%20certificate), it should work for all executables (note: haven't tested this.)

In most cases, `tokmon` relies on the `usage` field in OpenAI's API responses for token counts. For streaming requests, however, `tokmon` uses OpenAI's [tiktoken library](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) directly to count the tokens. As of writing OpenAI's API does not return usage data for streaming requests ([reference](https://community.openai.com/t/usage-info-in-api-responses/18862/11).)

## pricing.json
The pricing data was extracted from OpenAI's website with the help of ChatGPT.

`tokmon` is using [tokmon/pricing.json](tokmon/pricing.json) from its package. 

```json
{   
    "last_updated": "2023-04-12",
    "data_sources": [
        "https://openai.com/pricing",
        "https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility"
    ],
    "gpt-4": {"prompt_cost": 0.03, "completion_cost": 0.06, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "gpt-4-0314": {"prompt_cost": 0.03, "completion_cost": 0.06, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "gpt-4-32k": {"prompt_cost": 0.06, "completion_cost": 0.12, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "gpt-4-32k-0314": {"prompt_cost": 0.06, "completion_cost": 0.12, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "gpt-3.5-turbo": {"prompt_cost": 0.002, "completion_cost": 0.002, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301": {"prompt_cost": 0.002, "completion_cost": 0.002, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "text-davinci-003": {"cost": 0.02, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "text-curie-001": {"cost": 0.002, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "text-babbage-001": {"cost": 0.0005, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "text-ada-001": {"cost": 0.0004, "per_tokens": 1000},
    "text-embedding-ada-002": {"cost": 0.0004, "per_tokens": 1000}
}
```

You can override the default pricing with: `tokmon --pricing /path/to/your/custom_pricing.json ...`

## Current Limitations
1. Event streaming: `tokmon` buffers Server-Sent Events (SSE) until the `data: [DONE]` chunk is received. If the monitored program leverages event streaming, its behavior will be modified.
    - Status: looking into it. Pull requests welcome.
