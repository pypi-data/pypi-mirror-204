``As for improvements to features and code, here are a few suggestions: 1. Add functionality to download only the latest episode or a specific number of latest episodes. 2. Allow users to limit the download of episodes based on a date range or the age of the episodes. 3. Implement automatic episode cleanup based on user-defined criteria, such as age or total storage space used. 4. Add support for downloading episodes in parallel to speed up the download process. 5. Implement a more interactive CLI using a library like `click` to provide a more user-friendly experience. Remember to thoroughly test any new features or code changes before committing them to the repository.``
