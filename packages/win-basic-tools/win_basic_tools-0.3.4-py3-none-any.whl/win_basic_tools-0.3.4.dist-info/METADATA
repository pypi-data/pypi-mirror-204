This will create aliases like `python -m win_basic_tools -acil`, "acil" being each letter an option.  
'a' for all files, 'c' for colors, 'i' for icons and 'l' for list.  
  
It will create the `.macros.doskey` at your home directory and point it in Registry.  
After refreshing your prompt, you can use `ls`, `ll`, `touch`. See `%USERPROFILE%\.macros.doskey` for the list of aliases.  
  
Uninstall: run `win-basic-tools uninstall` before `pip uninstall` for reseting Registry.
