## Summary

CoLRev is an open-source environment for collaborative literature reviews. It integrates with differerent synthesis tools, takes care of the data, and facilitates Git-based collaboration.

To accomplish these goals, CoLRev advances the design of review technology at the intersection of methods, design, cognition, and community building.
The following features stand out:

- An open and extensible environment based on shared data and process standards
- Builds on git and its transparent collaboration model for the entire literature review process
- Offers a self-explanatory, fault-tolerant, and configurable user workflow
- Operates a model for data quality, content curation, and reuse
- Enables typological and methodological pluralism throughout the process

See the [statements of development status](https://colrev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/foundations/dev_status.html) and [documentation](https://colrev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details. A brief overview presented at ESMARConf2023 is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfGGraQC6vs).
