# Command Line ASCII Art Generator

ASCII-cli is a command line interface that is powered by Python3. You can generate ASCII art by importing an image and then selecting the character set that you want to generate with.

## Installation & Building

### PIP

The easiest way to install ASCII-CLI is by using the [PyPI library](https://pypi.org/project/ascii-cli/).
You can run `pip install ascii-cli` on any command-line with Python3 in order to install it.

### Releases

If you are unable to use the PyPI library you can access ASCII-CLI by going to our [releases page](https://github.com/mrq-andras/ascii-cli/releases). There you can download the .exe file and run the CLI by going to the folder that the program is downloaded in and running `.\ascii-cli`

## Usage

`ascii-cli [-h] [--width] [--height] [--set] [--random] [--invert] [--darkness] path/to/your/image`

Set 1: /, !, =, +, |, #, %,@, 0-9, ?, [, ], {, }, A-Z.  
Set 2: 0, O, o, 8, 9, 6, @, &, ., ", :.  
Set 3: ▀, ▄, ▌, ▐, ■, ◽, ◆, ►, ●, ░, ▒, ▓, █.

**_NOTE: SET 3 MIGHT NOT DISPLAY CORRECTLY IN CERTAIN FONTS OR EDITORS_**

If you have downloaded the application through pip input the following command in the terminal:  
`ascii-cli --width 40 --height 17 --set 1 --random True path\to\input.jpg`

If you are running the .exe package you will need to slightly alter the command by calling the exact folder of ASCII-CLI  
`.\path\to\ascii-cli.exe --width 40 --height 17 --set 1 --random True path\to\input.jpg`

This command will set the width to 40, the height to 17 and the character set to one. The `--set 1` variable is optional as the default character set is one. Random has been set to true and it will take the image from assets/input.jpg and generate a .txt file titled input-ascii.jpg in the same folder as the image.

Random and Invert are boolians and must be set to True/False, whereas Darkness, Set, Height and Width are all integers.
