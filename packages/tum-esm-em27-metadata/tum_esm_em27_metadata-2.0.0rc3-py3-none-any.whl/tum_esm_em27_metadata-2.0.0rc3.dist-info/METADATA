# EM27 Metadata

## The purpose of this library

This repository is the single source of truth for our EM27 measurement logistics: "Where has each station been on each day of measurements?" We selected this format over putting it in a database due to various reasons:

-   Easy to read, modify and extend by selective group members using GitHub permissions
-   Changes to this are more evident here than in database logs
-   Versioning (easy to revert mistakes)
-   Automatic testing of the files integrities
-   Easy import as a statically typed Python library

<br/>

## How it works

This repository only contains a Python library to interact with the metadata. The metadata itself is stored in local files or a GitHub repository. The library can load the metadata from both sources and provides a unified interface with static types to access it.

<br/>

## Library Usage

Install as a library:

```bash
poetry add tum-esm-em27-metadata
# or
pip install tum-esm-em27-metadata
```

```python
import tum_esm_em27_metadata

em27_metadata = tum_esm_em27_metadata.load_from_github(
    github_repository="org-name/repo-name",
    access_token="your-github-access-token",
)

# or load it from local files
em27_metadata = tum_esm_em27_metadata.load_from_local_files(
    locations_path="location-data/locations.json",
    sensors_path="location-data/sensors.json",
    campaigns_path="location-data/campaigns.json",
)

metadata = em27_metadata.get(
    sensor_id = "ma", date = "20220601"
)

print(metadata.dict())
```

Prints out:

```json
{
    "sensor_id": "ma",
    "serial_number": 61,
    "utc_offset": 0,
    "pressure_data_source": "ma",
    "pressure_calibration_factor": 1,
    "output_calibration_factor": 1,
    "date": "20220601",
    "location": {
        "location_id": "TUM_I",
        "details": "TUM Dach Innenstadt",
        "lon": 11.569,
        "lat": 48.151,
        "alt": 539
    }
}
```

The object returned by `em27_metadata.get()` is of type `tum_esm_em27_metadata.types.SensorDataContext`. It is a Pydantic model (https://docs.pydantic.dev/) but can be converted to a dictionary using `metadata.dict()`.

You can find dummy data in the `data/` folder.

<br/>

## Set up an EM27 Metadata Storage Directory

You can use the repository https://github.com/tum-esm/em27-metadata-storage-template to create your own repository for storing the metadata. It contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically validates the metadata on every commit in any branch.

<br/>

## For Developers

Run tests:

```bash
# used inside the GitHub CI for this repo
pytest -m "ci"

# used inside the GitHub Actions workflow for storage repos
pytest -m "action"

# can be used for local development (skips pulling from GitHub)
pytest -m "local"
```

Publish the Package to PyPI:

```bash
poetry build
poetry publish
```
