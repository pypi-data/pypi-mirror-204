kfactory
===================================


**KFactory** is a electronics design automation (EDA) tool. It is a spiritual successor of `gdsfactory <https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/>`_. In contrast to gdsfactory, KFactory is built solely on top of `KLayout <https://klayout.de>`_ and replaces the geometric and cell components with their counterparts of KLayout.
