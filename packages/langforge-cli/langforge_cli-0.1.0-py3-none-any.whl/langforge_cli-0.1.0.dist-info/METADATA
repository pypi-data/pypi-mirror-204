LangForge is an **open-source toolkit** designed to make it easy to create and deploy **_LangChain applications_**.

With LangForge, you can easily **_set up your environment_**, manage API keys, **_chat with your chains_** using the **_Jupyter integration_**, and **_automatically generate a REST interface_** for your app. Additionally, LangForge comes with a collection of **_predefined notebooks tailored for various use cases_**, allowing you to quickly get started and adapt them to your specific needs.

## Features

- Simplified environment setup and API key management
- Predefined notebooks for various use cases to help you get started quickly
- Instantly chat with your chains using the Jupyter integration
- Automatic REST interface generation for your app

## Installation

To install LangForge, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install langforge-cli
```

## Getting Started

1. **Create a new LangChain app:** Use the create command to generate a new LangChain app. LangForge will set up a virtual environment, install the required packages, and configure the API keys, setting up a ready-to-use foundation for building your app.

```bash
langforge create myapp
```

2. **Launch JupyterLab:** Run the langforge lab command to launch Jupyter Lab. LangForge Lab comes with ready-to-use notebooks for various use cases and an integration that allows you to chat with your chains directly within Jupyter.

```bash
langforge lab
```

3. **Serve your app:** LangForge automatically generates a REST interface for your app, making it easy to deploy and share with others. Use the `serve` command followed by the name of your notebook to start serving your app.

```bash
langforge serve my_notebook.ipynb
```
