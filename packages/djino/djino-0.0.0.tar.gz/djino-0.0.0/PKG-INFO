# 🧞‍♂️Djino 

**"A magical tool to craft numerical simulations"**

## ☕️ About
**Djino** (pronounced "Djinn-o") is an **open source platform** based on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web apps technologies to make **numerical simulation building** a **breath**.

At first, **Djino** is a web-based platform for solving [Partial Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) using the [Finite Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method).

The aim of **Djino** is to **manage** the **cumberstone stuff** wich is generally involved when finite elements simulations are developed. Thus, the **user** can be more focused on the **problem** to solve and the **physics/models** rather than to be **absorbed** in technical implementations details.

## 🐍 Built on the Python ecosystem

We do not want to **reinvent the wheel**, that's why **Djino** is built upon **(Numerical) Python ecosystem**. It is **batteries included** wich means that the necessary **tooling** is provided in order to craft **end to end** finite element simulations:

- 🕸️ Mesh generation ([Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/),[Meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) ) 
- ⚙️ Efficient FEM solver ([FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/))
- 📈 Results visualization ([PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/),[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/)...)

## ⚠️ Under construction
This platform is at the **early developement stage** and is truly **experimental**.
This mean **most** of the features are **missing** and the documentation is still **lacking**.
The project **github** repository will be available soon ! Stay tuned !
