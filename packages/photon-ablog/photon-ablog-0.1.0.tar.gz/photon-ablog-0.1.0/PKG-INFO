Description: The **PHOTON platform - ablog** is forked from https://github.com/sunpy/ablog
        at v0.10.25
        
        ABlog is a Sphinx extension for generating a log oriented static site. It
        can be easily integrated with documentation for Python modules.
        
        I am planning a major refactoring of this project, mostly to integrate it into a larger set of requirements. This will probably result in breaking changes to any further updates from SunPy.
