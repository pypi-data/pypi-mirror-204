        ## Use openai chat-gpt on your CLI
        `cgpt` is a Python module that allows you to use Chat-GPT directly in your favorite Terminal.
        
        ### ⭐ FEATURES
        
        - AI conversation exactly the same as in openai website
        - LAN support (you can use cgpt inside a LAN)
        - Docker support
        
        ### REQUIREMENTS
        
        - python >=3.7
        - openai API KEY : 
        
        You need to register on openai to receive your own api key , here : [api_key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
        
        ### SETUP
        
        ```
        pip install cgpt
        ```
        
        ### ⏯️ VERIFY INSTALLATION 
        
        ```
        cgpt-version
        ```
        
        ### 🚀 RUN
        
        ```
        cgpt
        ```
        
        ### 🔗 CGPT INSIDE A LOCAL NETWORK
        
        You can use cgpt inside a LAN. 
        
        - You just need one Host (`connected to internet`) to be the server.
        - Other Hosts (`not connected to internet`) can ALWAYS use Chat GPT as `client`. 
        
        NOTES : 
        
        - For now , a server must be launched inside a `Linux` computer . If the server is inside `Windows` : the address is sometimes wrong (to be fixed in the next version). 
        
        - Also , make sure that your `/etc/hosts` is configured correctly like :
        
        ```
        127.0.0.1	localhost
        127.0.1.1	your-hostanme
        ```
        
        - A `client` can also use his own api_key in the next version.
        
        ### 🐋 RUN INSIDE DOCKER
        
        - To make it easier , use the `docker-compose.yml` file : 
        
        ```
        docker-compose run --rm app
        ```
