# This test works with a document with a statement that starts with an RST
# directive. The expectation is that the statement is rendered as "<...>" on the
# DTR page because we are truncating statements there, and we cannot know if
# we truncate a statement in the middle of an RST directive or not. Incorrectly
# truncated RST text causes the RST->HTML renderer to fail with an error.
