TITLE: Open source software

[FREETEXT]
StrictDoc is based on other open source components. Without this support, we would have never reached where we are today.

StrictDoc was heavily inspired by the `Doorstop <https://github.com/doorstop-dev/doorstop>`_ project. Without the strong example of Doorstop, StrictDoc would probably never exist.

StrictDoc uses `textX <https://github.com/textX/textX>`_ as an underlying parser for the SDoc text markup language.

StrictDoc uses `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ and `Docutils <https://docutils.sourceforge.io>`_ for generating SDoc documents to RST, HTML and PDF formats.

StrictDoc has a satellite project `reqif <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/reqif>`_ which is built on top of the `lxml <https://lxml.de>`_ parser. The ``reqif`` library allows StrictDoc to import and export documents from/to ReqIF format.

StrictDoc uses `FastAPI <https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi>`_ and a combination of `Turbo.js <https://turbo.hotwired.dev>`_  and `Stimulus.js <https://stimulus.hotwired.dev>`_ for its Web-based graphical interface. This combination helps StrictDoc to stick with the `HTML over the wire approach <https://hotwired.dev>`_.

StrictDoc uses `Jinja <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com>`_ as a templating engine. Jinja is used for both static HTML and RST exports as well as in the Web-based GUI.

StrictDoc uses `Pygments <https://pygments.org>`_ to color-code the source files for its "requirements to source files" traceability feature.

StrictDoc uses `XlsxWriter <https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io>`_ and `xlrd <https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for its Excel export/import features.

The credits also recursively go to the building blocks of each of the above projects because most of them have their own dependencies.

Refer to the `configuration file <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc/blob/main/pyproject.toml>`_ for an up-to-date summary of StrictDoc's dependencies.

TITLE: Hosting and Continuous Integration

[FREETEXT]
StrictDoc is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ and uses `GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`_ to run all of its build, test and release tasks. As an open-source project, StrictDoc gets these services from GitHub for free.

StrictDoc's documentation is hosted on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_.

TITLE: Commercial IDEs by JetBrains

[FREETEXT]
The StrictDoc's core team uses the commercial versions of
`PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_
and
`WebStorm <https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/>`_
from `JetBrains <https://www.jetbrains.com/>`_.

The `Licenses for Open Source Development - Community Support <https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/#support>`_ from JetBrains are provided to the core team for free, based on the precondition that StrictDoc is developed as completely free software, without any monetization mechanisms.

Before the license for the commercial JetBrains was obtained in 2023, the complete StrictDoc's Python codebase had been produced using `PyCharm, the Community edition <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download>`_.
