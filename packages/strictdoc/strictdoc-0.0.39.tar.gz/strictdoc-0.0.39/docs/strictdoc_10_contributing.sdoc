Contributions to StrictDoc are welcome and appreciated.
Presented below is a condensed checklist that summarises the information
of the development guide, see [LINK: DEVGUIDE_GETTING_STARTED].

TITLE: Contributor checklist

[FREETEXT]
Before opening your Pull Request, the contributor is encouraged to do the
following steps:

1. Run ``invoke check`` tasks locally. This task calls several lint and test
   scripts and it is the very task that is run by the GitHub CI process.
2. A contribution that contains changes to the StrictDoc's codebase shall also
   include tests that exercise the changed behavior. A contribution without any
   tests is unlikely to be accepted (with the exception of "code climate"
   changes, see [LINK: DEVGUIDE_PYTHON_CODE]).
3. Follow the conventions of the section [LINK: DEVGUIDE_GIT_WORKFLOW].
   A clean Git history and conventional commit names are expected for every
   single contribution.
4. If the contribution is not trivial, read through the complete development
   guide.

TITLE: ReqIF users

[FREETEXT]
The existing capability of StrictDoc to export/import SDoc to ReqIF is very basic. If you have to deal with ReqIF and you experience errors/crashes when using StrictDoc against ReqIF files, feel free to contribute the anonymized ReqIF files via StrictDoc Issues on GitHub, and we will take care of your specific case.

It is straightforward to create an anonymized version of a ReqIF file. Just reduce your file to the section that causes troubles in import or export and replace all your business-specific titles/texts to some `Lorem ipsum...` boilerplate, see https://www.loremipsum.de/.

TITLE: TeX / LaTeX / Sphinx experts

[FREETEXT]
The existing template for generating PDF documents using Sphinx looks like this: https://strictdoc.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/. The template is maintained in a separate repository: https://github.com/strictdoc-project/sphinx-latex-reqspec-template and does a good job but could be improved in terms of look and structure used.

If you are an expert and have experience of customizing Sphinx/TeX templates, consider providing feedback or contributing patches.

One extreme way of improving the generated output could be to take the Sphinx template for TeX files and fully customize what Sphinx does to produce a PDF. See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/latex.html.
