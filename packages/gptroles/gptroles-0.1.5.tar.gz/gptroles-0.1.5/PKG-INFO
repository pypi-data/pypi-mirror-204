#### Roleplayer
It has a "roleplaying" root prompt that attempts to make implementing more roles into ChatGPT easier.
You can add "roles" to the root prompt, by default there are some roles related to commands and programming.

You can also change the root prompt to something else entirely, there's a list of some prompts that are sourced online, see features.

###### Command Role

Not fully implemented

    - RoleGPT can request web pages or from APIs to answer your questions.
        e.g. get current prices or latest news.
    - Provide basic shell commands that will be automatically be run, to find or list files etc
    - Instructions to format markdown for the programming features

#### App Features

Programming related features:

    - Run shell or python code in markdown blocks directly in the chat interface
    - Edit the markdown blocks in the chat box
    - Copy or save markdown blocks to a file

Additional features:

    - Easily switch or add more "roles"
    - Remove the roleplaying root prompt and set it as you please
    - List roles from jailbreakchat.com and set them as the root prompt
