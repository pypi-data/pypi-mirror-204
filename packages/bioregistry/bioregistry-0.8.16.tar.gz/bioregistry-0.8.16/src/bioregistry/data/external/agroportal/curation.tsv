GACS	Global Agricultural Concept Scheme	http://agrisemantics.org/gacs/	The Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS) is a hub for concepts related to agriculture, in multiple languages, for use in Linked Data. The idea for GACS emerged out of discussions at the World Congress of IAALD, the International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists, in July 2013. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), CAB International (CABI), and the National Agricultural Library of the USA (NAL) agreed in October 2013 to explore the feasibility of developing a shared concept scheme by integrating their three thesauri: the AGROVOC Concept Scheme, the CAB Thesaurus (CABT), and NAL Thesaurus (NALT). In the GACS vision, the integration of these three thesauri is but the first step towards the realization of a hub that links to and from the concept schemes beyond the initial three, and in multiple language areas.

PEAO	Plant Experimental Assay Ontology	https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology	The Plant domain has been the subject of several attempts to structure and formally define terms and corresponding relations, such as their anatomical features, developmental stages, and the application of particular experimental procedures to a biological problem. However, a focus on experimental assays in order to describe the whole experimental procedure, to the best of our knowledge, has only been attempted in the context of a very general description based on classical views of the scientific method. In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation.

The list of use cases, standards and requirements that guided the creation of SAREF4AGRI are described in the associated ETSI TR 103 511., This ontology extends the SAREF ontology for the Agricultural domain. This work has been developed in the context of the STF 534 (https://portal.etsi.org/STF/STFs/STFHomePages/STF534.aspx), which was established with the goal to create three SAREF extensions, one of them for the Agricultural domain.
SAREF4ENVI	SAREF4ENVI: an extension of SAREF for the environment domain	https://saref.etsi.org/saref4envi/	The present document is the technical specification of SAREF4ENVI, an extension of SAREF [1] for the environment domain. The extension was created in collaboration with domain experts in the field of light pollution currently working in the STARS4ALL European H2020 project (http://www.stars4all.eu/index.php/lpi/). The STARS4ALL project is composed by partners such as Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, ESCP Europe, Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, University of Southampton, Europan Crowdfunding Network, and CEFRIEL (Società Consortile a Responsabilita Limitata). SAREF4ENVI has two main aims: on the one hand, to be the basis for enabling the use of SAREF in the environment domain and, on the other hand, to exemplify how to enable interoperability between environmental devices in cooperation. SAREF4ENVI is an OWL-DL ontology that extends SAREF with 32 classes (24 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 7 reused from the time, SAREF and geo ontologies), 24 object properties (22 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 2 reused from the SAREF and geo ontologies), 13 data type properties (9 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 4 reused from the SAREF ontology), and 24 individuals (9 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 12 reused from the OM ontology). SAREF4ENVI focuses on extending SAREF for photometers to solve the lack of interoperability between sensors that can measure and share information about light pollution. Such extension involves the following use cases (more details can be found in ETSI TR 103 411 [i.1]): Use case 1: Monitor light pollution in a city, through the data collected by photometers about the magnitude of the light emitted in a given area. Use case 2: Adjust lampposts light intensity due to high pollution, after identifying the most contaminating lampposts and therefore the areas where more energy is being thrown away. Use case 3: Register a photometer, in which a new collection of photometers is incorporated into an existing sensor network.
SFWO	Soil Food Web Ontology	https://github.com/nleguillarme/soil_food_web_ontology/	The Soil Food Web Ontology (SFWO) is a OWL ontology which provides a standardised terminology and a logical formalisation of the domain of soil trophic ecology. It proposes a reference vocabulary to describe information about trophic interactions, feeding preferences (diets) and feeding processes of soil biota. By harmonizing the definitions of trophic groups, SFWO provides a common, logically-sound framework for soil-associated consumers classification across taxonomic groups and trophic levels. The Soil Food Web Ontology aims at being a reference ontology for soil trophic ecology, and a resource for ontology-driven applications in the field, including: trophic trait datasets standardization, trophic data integration and knowledge graph construction, automated soil food web reconstruction using OWL reasoning, and trophic information extraction., The Soil Food Web Ontology (SFWO) describes concepts related to the trophic ecology of soil organisms, including feeding preferences, food resources, trophic processes, and trophic groups, across taxonomic groups and trophic levels. SFWO aims at being both a reference ontology -including a standardised vocabulary- for soil trophic ecology, and an application ontology, with a focus on reasoning-based applications.
SNPO	Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Ontology	https://members.loria.fr/ACoulet/files/snpontology1.6_description.html	SNP-Ontology is a domain ontology that provides a formal representation (OWL-DL) of genomic variations. Despite its name, SNP-Ontology, is not limited to the representation of SNPs but it encompasses genomic variations in a broader meaning. SNP-Ontology is general enough to enable the representation of variations observed in genome of various species. Latest versions of SNP-Ontology include the representation of haplotype and of CNV. The unambiguous representation of genomic variations provided by SNP-Ontology enables to integrate heterogeneous data related to genomic variations. To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it, (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation, and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.
